<p>Few Machines vary more in quality than Carriages, the charge<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
for them varies as much;—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> best advice that can be offered to
the Reader, is, to “Deal with a Tradesman of Fair Character, and
established circumstances.—Such a person has every inducement to
charge reasonably, and has too much at stake, to forfeit, by any
silly Imposition, the Credit that he has been years in establishing
by careful Integrity.”——<i>Dr. Kitchiner’s</i> <span class="smcap">Housekeeper’s
Ledger</span>, 8vo. 1826, p. 20.</p>

<p>Those Carriages which cost least, are not always <i>the Cheapest</i>,
but often turn out, in the end, to be the <i>Dearest</i>.</p>

<p>Of Chariots, that appear to be equally handsome to a common Eye, which
has not been taught to look minutely into the several parts of their
machinery; One may be <i>cheap</i> at 250<i>l.</i>, and Another may be
<i>dear</i> at 200<i>l.</i>: notwithstanding, the Vender of the latter
may get more Profit than the Builder of the former.</p>

<p><i>The faculty of Counting</i>, too frequently, masters all the other
Faculties, and is the grand source of deception which Speculating
Shopkeepers are ever ready to take advantage of;—for catching the
majority of Customers, <i>Cheapness</i> is the surest bait in the
World,—how many <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>more people can count the difference between 20 and
25, than can judge of <i>the Quality</i> of the article they are about
to buy?</p>

<p><i>Quantity</i> strikes the eye at once.—It is recorded, that a
certain King having commanded his Treasurer to give an Artist a
Thousand Pounds for some work which his faithful Minister knew would
be most liberally paid for with half that sum; the sagacious Treasurer
ordered, Five Hundred Pounds in Silver to be laid upon a Table in a
Room which he knew that his Majesty would pass through with him. On
seeing the heap of Silver, the King exclaimed, “What’s all that Money
for?” The Treasurer replied, “Sire, it is half of the Sum which your
Majesty commanded me to give to the Artist.”—On which, the King said,
“Hey, hey! a deal of Money—a deal of Money—Half of that will do!!!”</p>

<p><i>Quantity</i> may be estimated by an uneducated Eye—to discern
<i>the Quality</i> of things, requires Experience and Judgment—capital
Guides; but with which the purchasers of Horses and Carriages are Years
before they acquire sufficient acquaintance to derive any benefit from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>them, and their chief security is, to deal with Persons who have
justly acquired, and long maintained, an unblemished Reputation.</p>

<p>I must here protest against a Custom which it is high time was
abolished, that of asking <i>Guineas</i> instead of <i>Pounds</i>,—as
Guineas are coined no more, there is no pretence for continuing this
trick of charging 5<i>l. per Cent extra</i>! Those who do it, know that
nobody would give them 105 <i>Pounds</i>; but, under the jingle of 100
<i>Guineas</i>, they contrive to poke an additional Five Pounds out of
your pocket!</p>

<p>As we have earnestly advised, that <i>the Coachman</i> may be made
independent of <i>the Coachmaker</i>, so let the latter be entirely
independent of the former.</p>

<p>Be not so perfunctory, as to permit your Coachman to order what he
pleases. If you send a Carriage to be repaired, with the usual Message,
“To do any little Jobs that are wanted,” you will most likely not have
a little to pay.</p>

<p>When any Repair is required, desire your Coachman to tell you; examine
it with your own Eyes, and with your own hand write the order to the
Coachmaker, &amp;c. for every thing that is wanted; and warn him you will
not pay <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>for any Jobs, &amp;c. not so ordered, and desire him to keep such
Orders and return them to you when he brings his Bill, that you may see
it tallies therewith, and you may keep a little Book yourself, into
which you may copy such Orders.</p>

<p><i>Counsellor Cautious</i> went one step further; and before any work
was begun, required a Note, stating for how much, and in how long, the
person would undertake to completely perform it.</p>

<p>However well built originally, the Durability of the Beauty and the
Strength of Carriages, depends much upon how they are managed;—they
are as much impaired by those to whose care they are entrusted, not
understanding, or not performing, the various operations which preserve
them, as they are by the Wear occasioned by Work.</p>

<p><i>In hiring a Coachman</i>, his having a due knowledge of how to take
care of a Carriage, is of as much importance as his experience in
Horses, or his skill in Driving.</p>

<p>Persons who order Carriages, are frequently disappointed in the
convenience and appearance of them, from not giving their Directions
in terms sufficiently explicit;—when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> those who buy Carriages make
any such a mistake, it is said, that those who sell are not always
remarkably anxious to rectify it, unless at the expense of the
proprietor.</p>

<p>An Acquaintance of the Editor’s, ordered that the interior of a New
Chariot should be arranged exactly like his former Carriage:—when
it was finished, he found that there were several very disorderly
deviations from the old plan, which were extremely disagreeable to
him:—the Builder said, civilly enough, that he was exceedingly sorry,
and would soon set it all right—which he did; but presented a Bill of
Ten pounds for mending these mistakes, which having arisen entirely
from his own Inattention to the fitting up of the Old Carriage, his
Customer successfully resisted the payment of, having been prudent
enough to have the Agreement for building the Carriage, worded, “That
it should be finished <i>in all respects to his entire satisfaction, by
a certain Time, for a certain Sum</i>.”</p>

<p>To the end of this work is added a Copious <i>Glossary</i>, and an
<i>Index</i>, which will readily conduct the Reader to the various
subjects, and be found extremely useful in explaining the Technical
terms, &amp;c. commonly used by Coachmakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The Editor has endeavoured to explain the various points in so plain a
manner, that persons who are previously entirely unacquainted with the
subject, may calculate exactly what will be the Expense, and ascertain
pretty accurately the best manner of managing, and of estimating the
pretensions of those they are about to employ, either to build or to
take care of a Carriage, &amp;c., in almost as little time as they can read
this little Book; in which it is hoped that they will find Amusement
blended with useful Instruction, and soon gain such a general knowledge
of the subject, as will effectually protect them from Imposition:—at
all events, the Editor is quite sure, that it will soon save the
Purchaser more than double what he has been so good as to give his
friend the old Coachman for the following advice.—Now <i>Cent per
Cent</i>, even in these times, when it is said that Cash is scarce, is
quite as large a profit as can be made by most Purchases! Therefore,
the Editor sends <i>Mr. Jervis’s</i> Book to Press, with a contented
conscience, and a hearty wish, that all who buy it may be able to
invest all their Money to equal advantage.</p>

Springs, as well as the Body: this prevents the Bolts and Nuts working
loose, and the Joints opening, &amp;c. <i>The Lamps</i> should be at the
sides; but the Dashing Iron ought to have in front a socket on each
side to place the Lamps in at Night, which will throw the light before
the Horse’s head, and prevent any shadow from the Wheels—when they
are used at the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>Sides, you see your danger just too late. <i>The

</div>
<p>I would not recommend a Carriage Horse to be less than Seven years old,
especially if to be driven in <i>Crowded Streets</i>:—Horses that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>have not been taught how to behave in such situations, are extremely
awkward and unmanageable, and often occasion Accidents.</p>

<p>As I have said, the Price charged for Job Horses varies as the goodness
of the Horses, and as the Work required, does. Some persons do not
Exercise their Horses enough;—others require Two Horses to do as much
Labour as should be done by Three. Again, the price of Horses varies
from less than £80. a Pair, to twice £80. a piece.</p>

<p><i>If you keep Horses for useful purposes</i>, you must not be too nice
about either their Colour, or the condition of their Coats.</p>

<p><i>The ordinary Town Carriage Work</i> can be done just as well by a
Pair of Horses, which may be had for £70. or £80. as with those that
cost three times that Sum; indeed it will most likely be done better.
If you have Horses worth an hundred pounds a piece, you will be afraid
of using them when you most want them; <i>i. e.</i> in Cold and Wet
Weather, for fear of their catching Cold and breaking their Coats,
&amp;c. Moreover, <i>the Elegance of an Equipage</i>, in the Eyes of most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>people, depends more upon the Carriage, Harness, and Liveries, than
upon the Horses:—all can judge of the former, but few of the latter;
and, provided they are the same Size and of the same Colour, the
Million will be satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Horses in Pairs</i> are sometimes worth double what they are,
singly—and Horsedealers do not like to buy any but of the most
common Colours; <i>i. e.</i> Bays and Browns; because of the ease in
matching them. Horses of extraordinary Colours may be purchased at a
proportionably cheap rate, unless they are in Pairs, and happen to
be an extraordinary good match, when they will sometimes bring an
extravagant price.</p>

<p><i>An Ancient Equestrian</i> gives the following advice; and also gave
us all those Paragraphs to which are affixed the initials A. E.:—</p>

<p>“<i>If you have occasion to match your Horse</i>, do not let the Dealer
know you are seeking for a <i>Match</i> Horse, or he will demand a
higher price; nor do not send your servant to select for you.”—See
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>the “<i>Hints to Purchasers of Horses</i>,” in <span class="smcap">Chap. IV</span>.</p>

<p>If you will be contented with the useful Qualities of your Horses,
<i>i. e.</i> their Strength and Speed, and are not too nice about their
matching in Colour, you may be provided with capital Horses, at half
the cost of those who are particular about their Colour; and moreover,
you may easily choose such as will do double the service.</p>

<p>The Judgment and Liberality of the Proprietors are not so questionable
on account of the <i>Horses</i> (which all the Wit and all the Wealth
in the World cannot always procure exactly what may be wished) as they
are about those works of Art, a <i>Carriage</i> and a <i>Livery</i>;
these, good Taste and Liberality can always command. The difference in
the charge for the hire of an elegant New Carriage and a shabby Old
one, does not exceed £25. <i>per Annum</i>; and £10. <i>per Annum</i>
more will defray all the extra expense incurred by giving a handsome
Livery; so there is not 10 per Cent saved in the Shabbiest turn out.</p>

<p>The advice of our great Dramatic Bard cannot be quoted more aptly than
in the following Maxim for choosing a Livery:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">“Costly thy Habit as thy Purse</div>

<p>We recommend a Blue, Brown, Drab, or Green Livery, the whole of the
same Colour. To have a Coat of one Colour, and lined with another, a
Waistcoat of another, and the other Clothes of another Colour, claims
the Poet’s censure—it is “Gaudy”—unless for a full Dress Livery on
a Gala Day:—we equally disapprove of the Capes of a Box Coat being
alternately Blue and Yellow, or Brown and Red, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Coachman’s Livery.</i></p>

<p>Those who affect an elegant Equipage, usually give their Coachman
annually, say Two handsome Suits of what is termed the best Second
Cloth (what is called Livery Cloth is a little cheaper, but much
coarser, and not half so serviceable).</p>

<p>For those who make but little use of their Carriage, <span class="smcap">One
Livery</span> a Year, or Two in Three Years, is enough, especially if you
give a Working-dress, as the Livery is then worn merely when he mounts
the Box to drive.</p>

<p>Those who give only <span class="smcap">One Livery in a Year</span>, should do that
in April, so that they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>may have the credit of it during the Summer
months, while it is seen: during the Winter it is almost always covered
by the Box Coat; when the Coat the man does his work in, will do as
well as any. If a Livery Coat has a Laced Collar, wearing the Box Coat
over it, will soon cut it to pieces.</p>

<p><i>Counsellor Cautious</i> never gave a Coachman a Livery till he had
served him for Three Months. Some Persons, instead of a Livery, allow
3<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> per Week extra, and the Coachman finds his own
Clothes, a plain Blue Coat; they giving him only a Hat and Great Coat.</p>

<p class="center">HIRING FOR A SHORTER PERIOD THAN A YEAR.</p>
<hr class="r5">


<p>If a Carriage be hired for a Day, a Week, or a Month, or for any time
less than a Year, the person who let it out pays the Duty.</p>

<p>The customary charge for those common Carriages, whether of Two or Four
Wheels, which are let out, is about 5<i>s.</i> per Day, or £5. per
Month (28 Days).</p>

<p><i>Open Carriages</i> are charged higher, as the whole Year’s Duty is
paid upon them, though they are only used for a few Months.</p>

<p>When Coaches or Chariots are let by the Day or Week, the <i>Harness</i>
is not included in the charge for them. Harness for a Pair of Horses is
charged 1<i>s.</i> per Day, or 5<i>s.</i> per Week.</p>

<p>Hired Carriages are expected to be turned out clean, greased, and fit
for immediate use:—examine them well before you take them; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> if
any part breaks while in your use, you will be expected to pay for the
Repair thereof, unless you make a previous Agreement that it shall be
done by the person letting it.</p>

<p>Tell the person you hire of, how long you want the Carriage, and how
far you are going to travel:—he has then no excuse for not giving you
a sufficient Carriage.</p>

<p>The price of a Job during the dear Months, when the Town is full,
<i>i. e.</i> in April, May, and June, for a Chariot or Coach, a Pair
of Horses and Coachman, his Wages and Board Wages, the standing at the
Hackneyman’s, &amp;c., and all charges included, is, (a little more or
less, according to the quality of the Horses and the Carriage), per
Month, (reckoning 28 Days), about £26.</p>

<p>The usual sum for <i>the Hire of a Coach or Chariot and Harness</i>,
is, according to the condition thereof, from £5. to £7. per Month:—if

<p class="center">JOBBING HORSES.</p>
<hr class="r5">


<p>We think that it is quite as Cheap, and are sure it is by far the most
Comfortable plan, to <i>Job Horses</i>:—if one of them falls sick or
lame, the Hackneyman immediately furnishes you with another—and you
avoid a vast deal of Inconvenience and Anxiety. This begins to be so
generally understood now, that not only Coach, but Cart and Waggon
Horses are <i>Jobbed</i> by the Year,—and Carts and Waggons also.</p>

<p><i>To Job Horses</i>, is particularly recommended to persons who are
ambitious of having an elegant Equipage;—a pair of fine Horses that
match exactly are always expensive to purchase; and if one of them
dies, it is sometimes, to a private Gentleman, extremely difficult to
find a fellow to it.</p>

<p>Horses cannot work equally, nor at ease to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> themselves, if they are not
nearly of the same Size, of the same Temper, and of the same Strength,
and have the same Pace, and Step well together.</p>

<p>A Hackneyman or Horsedealer, who is in an extensive way of business,
has so many opportunities of seeing Horses, that he can match a Horse
with much less Expense, and more exactly, than any Gentleman or any
Groom may hope to do: therefore, those who are particular about the
match of their Horses, will find it not merely more expensive, but much
more troublesome, to Buy than it is to Job.</p>

<p>Job Masters, in general, Sell, as well as Let Horses;—therefore,
stipulate in your Agreement, that you shall, be supplied with various
Horses till you are suited to your satisfaction; and then, that neither
of them shall be changed without your consent:—for this, a Hackneyman
may demand, and deserves, a little larger price; but it is Money paid
for the purchase of Comfort,—is the only way to be well served, and
prevents all disputes. If you do not make such an Agreement, and your
Hackneyman happens to be offered a good price for one of your Horses,
he may take it; and Your’s, like many other Carriages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> in London, will
be little better than a Break:—nothing is more disagreeable, nay,
dangerous, than to be continually drawn by strange Horses.</p>

<p><i>While the Job is travelling in the Country</i>, the Hackneyman is
allowed what is called Night, or Hay Money, <i>i. e.</i> an addition of
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per Night for each Horse, every Night the Horses
are out.</p>

<p>This is considered as a compensation for the increased price charged
for Corn at Inns, which is much more than it costs the Hackneyman at
Home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>—<i>Make some previous agreement in Writing about all
these things.</i></p>

<p>Some people who wish their Horses to be in high condition, yet desire
to avoid all Risk and Trouble, &amp;c. hire Horses, and find them in Corn,
&amp;c. themselves. A good Pair of Horses, without keep, are charged about
£70. <i>per Annum</i>.</p>

<p>The Old Proverb tells us, that “<i>The Eye<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> of the Master makes the
Horse Fat.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“The next care a man should take, after he has found a Horse to his
mind, and purchased him, should be to provide a Stable so situated,
with respect to his house, that he may see him very frequently, and
to have his Stall so contrived, that it may be as difficult a task to
steal his Horse’s provender out of the <i>Manger</i>, as to take his
own victuals out of the <i>Larder</i>.”—From <i>Zenophon’s Treatise on
Horsemanship</i>, translated in Berenger’s Entertaining and Instructive
Book upon Horsemanship, 4to. 1771. p. 231.</p>

<p>If you have valuable Nags, do not think it time lost, occasionally to
visit the Stable, and see that they are comfortably taken care of,
have their proper allowance of Corn, and are well bedded, &amp;c., and see
that the Corn be not brewed.—A smart Son of the Whip says, that “some
Hostlers are so clever, that they can turn Oats into Ale.”</p>

<p>The Word <i>Hostler</i>, I find in the most learned Lexicon in our
Language, which explains some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>thousands of words more than Johnson, is
written Oat-stealer—which this learned lexicographer says it must be
allowed appears to be the true word.</p>

<p>The Dictionary above alluded to is a very deep work:—instead of its
containing more words by thousands than are in Johnson,—Johnson does
not give us ten words that are in it—nor does it contain much above
ten words that are in Johnson: this admirable and elegant Dictionary
is entitled “A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, by F. Grose,
Esq., F.R.S. &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Some people fancy that they have made a capital Bargain, by stipulating
that the Hackneyman shall let their Carriage and Horses stand in his
Livery Yard, and so save part of the charge of a private Coach-house
and Stable:—if Hackneymen have plenty of Room, they have sometimes no
objection to this; however, you must take into the reckoning, that your
Carriage, while standing in an open Coach-house, and even while being
cleaned in a Public Yard, is unavoidably exposed to continual danger
from being carelessly run against by other Carriages passing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>to and
fro: moreover, it is often injured by the dirty Mops and Cloths, and by
the careless manner in which it is cleaned. If you wish your Carriage
to be turned out in nice condition, you must have your own Coach-house
and Stable; it is much more advisable, not only for your own Advantage,
but for the Comfort of your Coachman, which you will consider also, if
you expect him to consider your Interest.</p>

<p>It is extremely desirable to have Stables, &amp;c. adjoining your House;
because a Coachman, when your Carriage is not wanted, has many spare
hours in which he may be very useful in carrying Messages, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Coachmaker will keep the above Carriage <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>and Harness in Repair,
and find Wheels, &amp;c. for four Years, for £10. per Annum: this, at the
end of that time, would make its expense £381. 15<i>s.</i>, and it
might then be worth about £100.; so that if you purchase, it will cost
at least £70. per Annum, besides the Interest of the Money advanced:
moreover, you will have more than common luck, if you get £100. for it
at the end of Four Years.</p>

<p>If such a Chariot, with its appendages and Harness, as explained in the
above Estimate, be taken on a Job, (the longer the period you hire it
for, the less will be the annual charge,) for Four Years, the charge is
about £84. per Annum. It is not advisable to agree to take a Carriage
for a longer period than it will look well without being repainted, &amp;c.
After three or four Years, Carriages that are in continual use require
to go into Dock for a thorough repair.</p>

<p><i>A Landaulett</i> or a Landau is charged £10. per Annum more.</p>

<p><i>A Landau</i> is a Carriage in the form of a Coach, the upper part of
which may be opened for the advantage of air and prospect in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>Summer
time, and is principally intended for Country use, and is the most
convenient Carriage of any, as so many persons may be accommodated with
the pleasure of an Open and a Close Carriage in one, without the care
of Driving, as in other Open Carriages, or the expense and incumbrance
of keeping Two.</p>

<p><i>A Landau or Landaulett</i> is not only more expensive to build, but
more troublesome to keep nicely clean; and its Leather Roof much sooner
wears shabby, than the Japanned Roof of a Coach or Chariot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nota Bene.</span> It is customary for the Builder to warrant his
Work for the first Twelvemonths, and to undertake to make good all
failures happening within that time, which arise from the Timber or
Iron work’s breaking, but not those decays which necessarily follow
from reasonable use and wear, or damages by Accident. However, to
prevent all Misunderstanding, insert the following lines in your
Contract for Building:—also, that “after the Carriage has been out
about two or three months, and the Varnish has got thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> dry, the
Builder shall Polish it free of further expense.” This process can be
performed much better after a few months have elapsed, than it can when
the carriage first comes out, as the Varnish is not then sufficiently
hardened.—See <i>Cautions on Building Carriages</i>, at p. 65 et seq.
of this Work.</p>


<p class="center p2">TO JOB OR HIRE A CARRIAGE</p>

<p class="noindent">Is the most convenient and cheapest way of proceeding.</p>

<p>Carriages are usually hired for such a time as they may be expected to
last in Fashion, that is for about four or five years.</p>

<p><i>A One Horse Chaise</i> with Two Wheels may be jobbed for £20. to
£40. per Annum.</p>

<p><i>A Four Wheel Chaise</i> from £30. to £50.</p>

<p>The present charge for the hire of a Coach or Chariot, (see Estimate
No. IX.), Landau or Landaulett, and Harness, per Annum, is from £60. to
£100. One year of which is paid in advance.</p>

<p>Coachmakers will build a New Carriage for this purpose, and finish it
to your own fancy; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>exactly the same as if you were to purchase it, and
will paint it at the end of two or three years, if you hire it for a
longer period.</p>

<p>Persons who constantly require the use of a Carriage will do wisely
to <i>Hire</i>, and not for a longer period than Three or Four Years.
The frequent Repairs which are constantly wanting to Older Carriages,
occasion many Inconveniences, although the expenses of them are avoided
by Hiring.</p>

<p>Carriages are never better built than those which are made expressly
to be let on a Job. A Coachmaker takes care to choose materials and
workmen of the best kind for his own sake, to avoid those subsequent
charges, which, as has been observed before, constitute the evil of
inferior Carriages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> <i>In the Agreement for Hiring</i>, stipulate for the
option of purchasing the Carriage at the end of the First Year, at a
certain Sum, <i>i. e.</i> if the original price was £300., and you paid
£80. per Annum, for £220. <i>After a Year’s wear, you will be able to
see pretty clearly what kind of a Carriage you have got, and whether it
is worth purchasing.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p><i>Harness</i> is usually engaged with the Carriage, which is kept
in Wheels and all Repairs, excepting those which are required from
Accidents.</p>

<p>When Carriages are let by the Year, the following engagement is usually
entered into by the contracting Parties:—</p>


<p class="center">COPY OF AGREEMENT.</p>

complete and whole, excepting such deficiencies as may be expected from
reasonable use and wear, provided always, and on condition, that if the
said A. B. shall, during the said term of four Years, pay the said C.

<p>The Art of <i>Coachmaking</i> within these last Thirty Years, has
been improved greatly in Beauty, Strength, and Convenience; and a
Carriage is now considered as a distinguishing mark of the taste of its
Proprietor.</p>

<p>There are few works of Art which require the aid of so
many different Artists as the constructing of a Carriage;
there are Wheel-wrights,—Spring,—Axle-tree,—Step,—and
Tire,—Black and White Smiths,—Brass
Founders,—Engravers,—Painters,—Carvers,—Carpenters,—Joiners,—Trimmers,—Lace
Makers,—Lamp Makers,—Curriers,—Collar Makers,—Harness Makers, &amp;c.
&amp;c.; and upon the quality of the Materials, and the capacity of these
Workmen to execute their respective parts in a perfect manner, and upon
the taste and skill of the Coachmaker in combining them, depends the
Beauty and the Durability of the Carriage.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p class="center p2">ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF CARRIAGES.</p>

<p><i>The best time to bring out a New Carriage</i>, is about April or
May, before the extreme heat comes on; moreover, the Taxes are reckoned
from one 5th of April to another: and if you enter a Carriage on the
5th of March, you will have to pay for a whole Year, for only one
Month’s use of it.</p>

<p>If you have any thing peculiar about a Carriage, it will require much
more time in building, than if you are contented with merely ordering
“a fashionable Vehicle.” In the former case, do not hope to get it
under Three, nor be surprised if you wait Four Months for it.</p>

<p>However, if you have no particular desire to be disappointed, summon to
your assistance the aid of those powerful refreshers of a perfunctory
Memory, the <i>Goose</i>, the <i>Calf</i>, and the <i>Bee</i>;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
<i>i. e.</i> take <i>Mr. Jervis’s</i> advice, and bind the Builder in
a written contract, made by your Attorney, and duly Stamped, Signed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>Sealed, and Witnessed, &amp;c., to deliver the Carriage, Harness, &amp;c.
completely finished on a certain day—or that he shall forfeit, and
that day shall pay to You, One Hundred Pounds, and keep his Carriage
himself.</p>

<p>Be careful that your Contract contains a full and very particular
description of every part; for</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>—If you order the least Alteration or Addition
afterwards, it will be charged <i>Extra</i>, unless you discreetly
insert a sweeping clause, that the Whole shall be completed to your
entire satisfaction, for the Money, and at the Time agreed upon.</p>

<p><i>An Honest Man</i> will have no more objection to sign a written
Agreement than to make a Verbal Promise, and <i>a Prudent Man</i> will
never take the latter when he can get the former:—the Expense of a
written Agreement is Money expended in preventing Anxiety, which is
like sacrificing a Pebble to preserve a Diamond:—those who wish to
avoid disappointments and litigation, will not stir one step without
<i>a Written Agreement</i>—’tis a pretty bit of Paper, that makes men
Honest, and keeps them so.</p>

<p>After you have settled what is to be the price of the New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>Carriage—then, before you sign the Agreement respecting it, make your
Bargain as to what Sum the Builder shall allow you for your Old One,
provided you do not previously otherwise dispose of it.</p>

<p><i>The Money allowed for an Old Carriage</i>, is less than a Novice
will expect. I sold one Chariot, which I had in use only Five years,
for only £15., nor could I get more for it, although I kept it for
several Weeks.</p>

<p>I sold another Chariot, which had been in wear about the same time, for
£30.,—and it is not often that a Builder will allow much more for a
Carriage that has been in use for five or six Years:—by that time, the
shape of the Body is out of Fashion, the Lining is shabby, and before
it can be sold again to a particular person, it must be thoroughly
repaired, which will cost a considerable Sum.</p>

<p>The following is an Estimate which was given to the Gentleman who
bought my last Chariot.</p>

<p>Now, if the Body had not been a beautiful piece of Work, it would not
have been worth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>while to have bestowed this large sum in renewing the
Carriage part: but the whole of the exterior of the Old Body, although
it had been built some Years, was more sound and unwarped, than most
new Bodies are on the first day they are turned out; it was elegantly
formed, and the Interior so admirably constructed for Comfort, that
from it I learned the dimensions, &amp;c. which I have given in the
following description of what I think a Chariot ought to be.</p>

<p>Coachmakers sometimes shew <i>Drawings of Carriages</i> for their
Customers to choose from,—it <i>is more satisfactory, not only to see,
but to take a ride in a pattern Carriage</i>; this your Coachmaker
can take you to see, or, if you see a Carriage which pleases your
Eye, your Coachman can easily learn where it is put up; go with your
Coachmaker and see it, and have <i>a written Particular</i> of all its
peculiarities, <i>an exact Measurement</i> of its dimensions, and <i>an
Estimate</i> in Writing of the cost thereof, similar to the one given
in <span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span> Estimate No. 9.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p><h2 class="nobreak" id="OF_THE"><span class="small">OF THE</span><br>

CONSTRUCTION OF A CHARIOT.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">


<p>The Novice in these things may think that the following description
is unnecessarily minute, and that he need only go to a Coachmaker and
order “<i>a Chariot</i>,” and that Word will procure him all he wishes.</p>

<p>The form of Carriages is as absurdly at the mercy of Fashion, as the
Cut of a Coat is;—however, if the Reader is willing to let the Builder
please himself with the form of the Exterior, he will perhaps not be
quite so polite as to submit the construction of the Interior entirely
to the caprice of his Coachmaker.—If “as easy as an old Coat” be a
true Aphorism, “as easy as an Old Carriage” is equally so:—by riding
three or four Years in one, you become so used to it, that any change
is extremely unpleasant—and if the Elbows or the Seat are too high, or
too low, or too narrow, or too wide, &amp;c. when the Body is built, it is
always difficult, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>often impossible, to alter it; therefore, if you
like your Old Body, measure it, and order your New one accordingly.</p>

<p><i>If you build a Body</i>, pay a visit to your Coachmaker while it is
in progress, especially just before it is put into the hands of the
Painter.</p>

<p>All Coachmakers, do not, always, go to the expense of covering the
Roof, Back, and Sides with one piece of Leather, as they ought to
do;—the common practice is to cover the Roof only with Leather, and
leave the Upper sides and back of pannel board, with a groove run in
the Roof where the Leather is nailed in covering the nails and filling
up the groove with Putty, which the Summer’s Sun and Winter’s Rain will
soon crack, and the Water entering will soil the Lining, and the Inside
of the Body will become damp:—the whole of the upper part of a Body
should be enveloped in one large hide of strong Leather, and neatly
worked in, so that it is one solid surface of Leather to paint on,
which neither Heat nor Wet can affect for many Years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p><i>The Breadth of a Body</i>, to contain three persons comfortably,
should not be less than 4 feet 3 inches.</p>

<p><i>From Back to Front</i>, 4 feet are enough.</p>

<p><i>The Height of the Seat</i> from the bottom, about 1 foot.</p>

<p><i>From the Seat to the Roof</i>, not less than 3 feet 6 inches; the
Cushions, which are commonly about three inches in thickness, not
included.</p>

<p>A few Inches in Width and Breadth add but a few Pounds to the Weight,
but contribute greatly to the Convenience of a Carriage, especially to
well-grown and full-fed persons.</p>

<p>The little thoroughly-ugly humpty-dumpty Chariot, which looked
something like a Champion Potatoe set on wheels, but which was the
grand rage with Children of the Largest Growth about 30 Years ago,
would not admit a small person to sit with his hat on, nor a tall one
with his Hat off:—these foolish little wee Vehicles weighed only a few
pounds less than the large commodious Chariots, in which the Lords and
Ladies of the Creation transport themselves in at the present day.</p>

<p><i>The Elbows</i> should not be more than 6 inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> above the Cushion,
and should be so entirely in recess, that you may lean comfortably
against the side of the Carriage:—in some ill-contrived modern bodies,
they are placed too high, and project out, and as often as you loll
towards them, remind you that you should not, and force you back into
your perpendicular, by giving you a Punch in your Side.</p>

<p>In a Chariot Body of the size just described, there should be a
<i>Front Seat</i> about 10 inches in width, which will occasionally
carry Two persons:—this addition is especially desirable in a
Travelling Chariot, as by sitting in one corner of the Carriage, you
may put your Legs upon it, and take a Nap very comfortably. This Front
Seat is doubly better than the old fashioned <i>Bodkin Seat</i> which
drew out from the centre; and when you have Two fellow Travellers,
in order to induce one of them to sit upon this accommodation seat,
you may tell them that they will sit three times as comfortably there
as on the front seat; for if they sit on that, they will be crowded
themselves, and crowd two other persons also; but if one sits on the
other seat, all may ride <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>comfortably enough:—it should be fixed on
with Slip-Hinges, so that it may be taken off at pleasure.</p>

<p><i>The Door Lights or Windows</i> are sometimes contracted on the
Seat side about 4 inches; however, some people like them as large as
possible, and besides, have the back of the Carriage stuffed eight or
ten inches deep, which is exceedingly convenient for those who are
anxious to exhibit themselves like Articles for sale in a Shew Glass.</p>

<p>Take care that <i>the Glasses</i> are of the best Quality, well
Polished, White, and as free as possible from Specs and Veins.</p>

<p>These Glasses are commonly bound with Cloth of the same Colour that
the Carriage is lined with, or with Black Velvet, which wears better,
and works in the grooves more pleasantly than any binding:—the most
elegant binding is Lace like that of the Glass-holders, or in which the
Crest or Arms are woven.</p>

<p><i>The present fashion of Stuffing</i> is preposterous; it reduces
a Large Body to the size of a small One: however, if you like to
ride about for the benefit of public inspection, as your friends, my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span><i>Lady Look-about</i>,—the <i>Widow Will-be-seen</i>,—and <i>Sir
Simon Stare</i>, do, pray study Geoffrey Gambado on the Art of sitting
politely in Carriages with the most becoming attitudes, &amp;c. and choose
wide Door Lights and full Squabbing;—if you wish to go about peaceably
and quietly, like <i>Sir Solomon Snug</i>, and are contented with
seeing without being seen, adopt the contracted Lights and common
Stuffing, which, among others, have this great advantage, that when
you sit back, you may have the side Windows down, and a thorough Air
passing through the Carriage, without its blowing in directly upon you:
this, to Invalids who easily catch Cold, is very important.</p>

<p><i>The Back Light</i> must not be more than 27 inches from the surface
of the Cushions, or it will be too high for a person to look through
it without rising up—it is convenient to have this made to Open, as
it affords an easy opportunity of giving directions to the person
behind the Carriage, and is a desirable aperture for admitting Air in
very hot weather:—tell the Builder to give you a fine clear plate
for this purpose, and not to glaze it with a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>semidiaphanous “<i>Old
Accident</i>,”—a technical term for those “Odds and Ends” of broken
Coach Glasses which are sometimes used for this purpose, and which
having been continually cleaned every day for thirty or forty years,
have become so scratched, that you can hardly see through them.</p>

<p>I recommend <i>the Lining to be Green</i>, with Lace to correspond, and
the Green <i>silk Sun shades</i> of the same Colour—Green is pleasant
to the Eye, and Superfine <i>Cloth</i> or Tabinet, is, during nine
months out of the twelve, much more comfortable in this Cold climate,
than the chilling <i>Leather</i> which has lately been the fashion:
in Summer this may be covered with what is commonly called a <i>False
Lining</i>, which is generally made of Gingham, and is equally useful
to preserve a New or hide an Old Trimming:—it should only be applied
to the back and those parts of the sides that are leaned against; the
Front, Roof, and Doors, should be left uncovered.</p>

<p>The Elegance of the Interior of a Carriage depends much upon the
pattern and breadth of <i>the Lace</i> with which the Lining is
bordered, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>of which there are a great variety.—Lace-making is a
distinct branch of Manufactory; and as “every Eye makes its own
Beauty,” the person who builds a Carriage should desire his Coachmaker
to furnish him with some patterns to choose from:—there are several
Coach Lace-makers in Long Acre.</p>

<p>Some Carriages are fitted up with Squabs, <i>i. e.</i> Cushions stuffed
with Wool and covered on one side with Cloth, and on the other with
Silk, Linen, or Leather; the former side for Winter, the latter for
Summer use.</p>

<p><i>The Seat Cushions</i> should be covered on one side with Leather,
and on the other with Cloth.</p>

<p>Let <i>the Stuffing at the Back</i> be no thicker than necessary to
make it easy, <i>i. e.</i> about 2½ inches in thickness.</p>

<p>Have <i>the Lid of the Sword Case</i> to fall down with the back
attached, instead of lifting up, being much easier to put in a parcel
without troubling the passengers to rise.</p>

<p><i>The Seats</i>, which are usually boarded, I would recommend to be,
on one side, Caned or Girt-webbed, for ease in Sitting—the other half
may be fitted up with a Case for containing Grog and Prog, &amp;c. for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>Rusticating Party:—they <i>should be about 22 inches deep</i>—not
more, or Short people cannot sit upon them comfortably:—they will be
much easier if made on a bevil, and about an inch lower behind than
they are before: if not originally so constructed, the stuffing of the
Cushions may be easily adjusted so as to produce that effect.</p>

<p><i>The Green Silk Spring Sun Shades</i> should be fixed upon the Doors;
this saves the trouble of putting them up every time you open the Door,
which must be done when they are fixed to the Body;—if the Blinds
are fixed on the Door, take care to shut it when you get out of the
Carriage in Wet Weather, or they will be spoiled:—<i>when the Silk
becomes faded</i>, if it is turned upside down, the part most in sight
will look almost as well as new.</p>

<p>If the Ground Colour of the Body is good, <i>New Varnishing</i> will
sometimes do almost as well as New Painting.</p>

<p>I am told that the best Colour for Wear is <i>Midgley’s Chrome
Yellow</i>. In consequence of the vivid brilliancy of this pigment, in
all the variety of its shades, from the pale Lemon <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>colour to the full
Orange, it has of late come into general use. When properly prepared,
it possesses all the desiderata of perfect Colours, Smoothness, Body,
Extensibility, and ready Mixture with Oil or Water, and dries well and
blends well.</p>

<p><i>Venetian Blinds</i> are delightful shades in warm Weather, as they
admit the Air while they exclude the Sun; and when closed, serve as a
shutter to prevent dust from soiling the Carriage while it is standing
by. They should be painted on the Inside, of a Verdigrise Green, and on
the Outside of the same Colour as the Carriage.</p>

<p>If these are not made of <i>extremely well-seasoned Wood</i>, they
rattle very much in Dry, and swell in Damp weather.</p>

<p>These Blinds should have <i>Bolts</i> affixed to them, which, when
fastened within, if you have <i>Locks</i> on the Carriage Doors, enable
you to fasten up the interior of your Carriage completely.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of Rain falls during the warmest months in this
Country, and our Chariots very much want <i>an Exterior Blind</i> (a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>Hood as it were) in the front, which would exclude Rain, while it
would admit Air:—many of our Wet days are so warm, that our Carriages
are a shower Bath if the Windows are open, and a Vapour Bath if they
are Shut!</p>

<p><i>The Handle of the Door Latch</i> should be double—that is, it
should have an additional Handle within side, the position of which
will afford you the satisfaction of seeing that the Door is properly
fastened, and also the power of easily opening it in case of an
Accident, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is a very great convenience to have <i>the power of opening the Door
from the inside</i>. This Handle should be made to turn towards the
Door, so as to be within the Door when the Door is opened, it will then
be out of the way of being struck against the Body in shutting; which,
if it turns to the Right, will sometimes happen when the Door is shut
by perfunctorious persons.</p>

<p>The spindles of these Handles during the first Year, till time has worn
them a little, will occasionally move too stiffly: the remedy for this
is a drop of Oil.</p>

<p>Never permit officious Strangers to shut <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>your Carriage Door; in order
to save their own time and trouble, and to accomplish this at once,
some idle and ignorant people will bang it so furiously, one almost
fancies that they are trying to upset the Carriage, the pannels of
which are frequently injured by such rude violence; therefore, desire
your Coachman to be on the watch, and the moment he sees any one
prepare to touch your Door, to say loudly and imperatively “<i>Don’t
meddle with the Door!</i>”</p>

<p>Have <i>Locks</i> to the Doors—they are very necessary when
travelling, or when your Carriage is waiting for you at Night: <i>a
Latch</i> inside that will fasten the Door so that it cannot be opened
on the outside, is also desirable, especially in Travelling Chariots.</p>

<p>In Landaulets the door opening without the window frame, particular
directions to the Footman are necessary that he observe the Glass is
entirely down before he attempts to open the Door, or the pane will
be infallibly broken. When the glass is quite up there is no danger,
for in rising it releases a Spring which fastens the Door; the blind
does the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>same; so that if the Servant keep the blinds up while the
Carriage is waiting, a lock may be dispensed with. I would recommend
the addition of this contrivance to Coaches and Chariots.</p>

<p><i>A Town Carriage</i> should not be more than three feet from the
Ground, so as to require only <i>One Step</i>; to which should be fixed
<i>a Strap</i>, by which any person within the Carriage may very easily
pull it up, and with the help of the <i>Inside Handle</i>, may, with
equal facility, finish the Footman’s Work, and fasten the Door.</p>

<p>The above is an invaluable contrivance, and well deserves to be called
“<i>a Dumb Footman</i>;” it entirely prevents the necessity of the
Coachman’s leaving his Box; from which rash act, many lives have been
lost, and many Carriages destroyed by the Horses running away<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>:—All
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>will adopt it, excepting those persons who are so unfortunate, as to
be more Proud than Prudent. <i>Mr. Jervis</i> was extremely earnest in
recommending these excellent appendages; and to impress the importance
of them upon the imagination of the Editor as strongly as possible,
he closed his arguments by averring, that for a Coachman to leave his
Reins would be as desperate an act of rashness as for a Cook to leave
her Kitchen while her Spit was going round, and equally likely to
produce the most tremendous and irreparable Evils!</p>

<p>If such a plan be adopted, the Body must not be hung further than
twenty-two inches from the Dickey, <i>i. e.</i> near enough to the
Coach Box to allow the Coachman to put his hand on the top of the Door
when it is opened, and hold it so while the Passengers get in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> out.
Till the Hinges are worn a little, they will occasionally get rusty and
move too stiffly, and require a little Oil.</p>

<p>The present fashionable <i>Door Handle</i> is too big by half, and
is also extremely inconvenient on account of the Hinge in it, which
requires an additional action, which in the course of a little wear
becomes ricketty and rattles, and you can hardly tell to a certainty
whether it fastens the Door completely or not.</p>

<p>The simple Handle without a Hinge, which was in vogue some years ago,
is infinitely more convenient and safe, because its single action is
more certain.</p>

<p><i>The Crest or Arms</i> in the Centre, is an elegant ornament for the
Head of the Handle.</p>

<p><i>A Boot or Budget</i> fixed on the fore Carriage between the front
Springs is useful to carry Horse Cloths, Luggage, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Hind Standards</i> are very useful for town work, to keep the Horses
and Pole of other Carriages from injuring your Hind Pannels; but as
they are a heavy weight, they should be made to take off for the
country.</p>

<p>A <i>Dickey Coach Box</i> is the most convenient;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span> it is less
impediment to the view of those who are inside the Carriage, and more
comfortable to the Coachman. They should be fixed on the Boot, and
entirely detached from the Body. Let it be large enough to contain
Two persons. It is not quite so easy as the Body; but for those who
love Air and Exercise, and a view of the Country, it is in Summer the
pleasantest place.</p>

<p><i>The Seat</i> thereof to hold Two persons, should be thirty Inches
wide and twenty Inches deep, inside measurement. <i>The Cushion</i>
should be of equal thickness, and not higher on the Driving side, as it
is in a Gig, because when only the Coachman is on the Box, he should
sit in the middle of it. There should be a Pocket on each side in the
lining, for putting Tickets in.</p>

<p>This kind of Coach Box may be so made as to take off, and fix on
behind the Carriage. Under the Seat, for the Coachman, should drop in
a Box to serve as a Tool Budget, and contain a few spare Bolts, Nuts,
Linch-Pins, Nails, a Wrench, a Winch that will fit your axle, Hammer,
Chisel, a Pair of Pincers, &amp;c.; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>by help of which, a trifling accident
on the Road may be remedied without delay.</p>

<p><i>Take care that your Coach Box is strongly and properly fixed on</i>,
and frequently examine the state of the Bolts and Nuts, &amp;c. For want
of sufficient strength, or of the efficient state of the supports to
it, many dreadful accidents have happened; one of which we relate as a
warning:—</p>

<p>“On Tuesday morning last, while the Coachman and the Footman, in the
service of F. P. Ripley, Esq., 12, Woburn Place, Russell Square, were
driving their Master’s carriage along Tavistock Place, Tavistock
Square, the box on which they were sitting broke down, and precipitated
them to the ground. The carriage wheels passed over the right leg of
the Coachman and the left breast of the Footman. They were conveyed to
their master’s with the greatest alacrity, where they received such
treatment as their situations required. The coachman’s leg is bruised
and lacerated extremely. The footman, on being raised from the ground,
was excessively convulsed. We <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>are sorry to add there are no hopes of
his recovery.”—<i>Times</i>, June 2, 1826.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Spikes to fix on the Hind Standards.</i></p>

<p>These spikes may be so contrived as to be put on and off very easily,
with Three Nuts, in as few minutes;—the Footman’s Step should be fixed
on in the same manner.</p>

<p><i>Do not permit Strangers to place themselves behind your Carriage</i>
at any time, or under any pretence whatever. There are innumerable
instances of Carriages having been disabled from proceeding, and
Travellers robbed and finished, by allowing such accommodation. The
Collectors of Check Braces, and Footmen’s Holders, assume all kind of
Characters, and are so expert, that they will take these articles off
in half the time that your Coachman can put them on; and will rob you
of what you cannot replace for a Pound, though they cannot sell them
for a Shilling.</p>

<p>Therefore, Spikes are indispensable when you have not a Footman;
otherwise, you will be perpetually loaded with idle people, <i>i.
e.</i> unless <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>you think that two or three outside passengers are
ornamental or convenient, or you like to have your Carriage continually
surrounded by Crowds of Children, incessantly screaming, “Cut! Cut
behind!” Why do not <i>the Street Keepers</i> prevent this Nuisance?
These officers should be stationed in Sentry Boxes, as they are in the
Parish of Bloomsbury, <i>i. e.</i> the same as the Watchmen are at
Night; where, when not going their Rounds, they should remain.</p>

<p>The multitude of <i>Strayed Dogs</i> which are perpetually prowling
and howling, and barking and biting at Horses’ heels, and making
them start, and those which <i>are carried about in Carts</i>,
also frequently frighten Horses and occasion Accidents, and are
barbarous and dangerous <i>Public Nuisances</i>, which “<i>the Street
Keepers</i>” should suppress.</p>

<p>Let it be enacted—that all Dogs, Fowls, and any other Beasts and
Birds, found in the Streets, <i>not having a Collar</i> on, on which
is engraven the Name and place of abode of the Owner thereof, shall
henceforth be seizeable by any Constable, or Street Keeper, or
Watchman, or any person who finds them; which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> they shall have power
to dispose of as their own property; and those <i>with a Collar</i>
also, unless their owners immediately pay a fine of five shillings; one
moiety of which shall be to the person finding them, the other to the
Poor of the Parish. For want of such salutary Regulations, some of the
Streets of London are like a Dog Kennel or a Poultry Yard.</p>

<p>These Beasts and Birds are seldom kept except by petty Housekeepers,
who are perpetually applying to be excused paying Taxes. Surely such
persons should not be permitted to annoy their neighbours, who by duly
paying Parish rates, in fact, contribute to their maintenance.</p>

<p class="noindent">for an hour together. They seldom give Tongue when inside of a House,
except when shut in by themselves in an Empty house. There are certain
Manufacturers who having more cunning than conscience, to evade paying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>the Taxes upon their Warehouse, instead of letting somebody sleep in
it, which would subject them to the Taxes, turn in a Dog as a Watchman,
who barks and howls incessantly all night long. Surely such shirking
Gentry are not entitled to the privilege of annoying a score or two of
quiet Neighbours, who honestly pay the Taxes imposed by their Country!
They and their Cur-Watchman should be indicted and amerced <i>sans
cérémonie</i>.</p>

<p>Fowls, Parrots, Dogs, or any other of those Beasts or Birds, which
(because they make most Noise) are vulgarly called <i>Dumb Animals</i>,
bleating, barking, bellowing, in the Front Area or back Garden of a
House, &amp;c. are an offence against the Public Peace—are an Indictable
Nuisance; and on the complaint of a Neighbouring Housekeeper, are as
cognizable by Constables, Street Keepers, Watchmen, &amp;c. surely as
justly as the Owners of such Animals would be, were they to hoot and
bellow there,—for which they would, in the first instance, be taken to
a Watchhouse, and in the second Indicted and fined or sent to the Tread
Mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Qy.</span> What difference does it make whether the Peace is
broken, and Sleep destroyed, by an “<i>Animal plumis, vel implumis
et bipes</i>,” <i>i. e.</i> whether it wears ready-made Clothes,
or employs a Tailor? Surely it will not be allowed in this Age of
Refinement, that the former is entitled to more consideration than the
latter.</p>

<p>They manage these things better in France. All Dogs, Fowls, &amp;c. found
in the Streets of <i>Paris</i>, are finished forthwith by the <i>Gens
d’Armes</i>.</p>

<p>It cannot be too generally known, that by <i>The Metropolis Street
Act</i> of the <i>57</i>th Geo. III. cap. 24. in § 67. “The
Commissioners of the Parochial Paving Boards are empowered to order the
removal of <i>any matter or thing which they consider a Nuisance, on
the complaint of any Inhabitant</i>.”</p>

<p>Such controlling power is but too needful—there is no lack of people
who love their <i>dear</i> “<i>Dumb Animals</i>,” as they call
their Dogs and Parrots, &amp;c. not a little better than they do their
Neighbours,—aye, who love them as well as <i>Simon Suck-eggs</i> does
his Fowls! who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>would not willingly sacrifice the penny profit he makes
by the oviparous faculty of his Poultry, however much, or however many
people may be annoyed by it.</p>

<p>If Persons who are offended by any of the above nuisances, apply to
the Clerk of the Commissioners of the Paving, and beg him to lay their
complaint before the Board, they will issue a mandate ordering their
immediate abatement as <i>a Public Nuisance</i>: and thus, the evil is
removed, without any of that unpleasant feeling which might arise from
one Neighbour complaining of another.</p>

<p>The Author is now framing “<i>a Sleep Act</i>,” which will shew the
importance of Sleep to Health, the causes which so often and so cruelly
disturb “<i>the Business of the Night</i>,” on the due performance
of which, depends our power of performing “<i>the Business of the
Day</i>,” and the remedies which the Legislature may easily apply for
its preservation. One of their most beneficial acts would be to abolish
a</p>

<p><i>Vulgar and Barbarous Custom</i> which prevails among common Workmen,
when they first come to work in the Morning, to make as much Noise as
they possibly can; thus, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span> live near any Manufactory, &amp;c., or if
a house is building or repairing near you—from Six in the Morning till
half-past, they will raise such a horrible din of Hammering, &amp;c. that
all within Ear shot of them are presently awoke; and indeed they seem
to do it for that sole purpose, for the following hours they are often
quiet enough.</p>

<p>Those who are so outrageously active so early in the day are
technically termed <i>Powters</i>, <i>i. e.</i> such extraordinary
industry being very often a mere manœuvre to deceive their
Neighbours, which they artfully affect to gain Credit, and which,
like setting up a shewy Shop Front, <i>is one of the usual tokens of
approaching Bankruptcy</i>.</p>

<p>Let it be enacted, that all Manufacturers do perform the Noisy part of
their processes during the middle of the Day:—this might be easily
managed in most trades without any interruption of their business! What
can be easier, than for the work which makes such a Noise during <i>the
first half hour</i> in the Morning to be done in <i>the last half
hour</i> in the Evening?</p>

<p>Let the <span class="smcap">Dog Tax</span> be levied without exception,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> (but as far as
regards only those which lead Blind Men,) and let due Rewards be given
to those who inform against persons who evade it, of whom there are not
a few, the only way of preventing which is to <span class="smcap">Let all Dogs wear
a Collar</span>, on which is engraved the Name and the place of Abode
of the Owner;—He who by Fraud avoids a Tax, which by the Laws of his
Country he is commanded to pay, is a Traitor, who commits a greater
Crime, and deserves as great a Punishment, as he who, by Force, breaks
into the Treasury, and takes so much Money out!!!</p>

<p>It is notorious, that the majority of these useless and offensive
Animals are maintained by paupers who have hardly the means of
maintaining Themselves!—these are the Dogs which, from spare and bad
food, are most frequently mischievous—most apt to run Mad—and are
most annoying and disturbing to the Public. “<i>As many Beggars, as
many Dogs</i>,” is one of our true Old Sayings, and of an Old Song,
to which in the next page we have had engraved as it was performed by
“<i>Betsy, Billy, and Bow Wow</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>When the Author first learned the Song between this and the next page,
which is now nearly half a Century ago, he was a good deal surprised
at the last line of it, and thought that it savoured more of Rhyme
than of Reason, notwithstanding his Grandma’ told him that “Time the
Teacher” would soon shew him, that Opulence and Independence, and Wit
and Wisdom, are not always inseparable;—that he would frequently find
Integrity dwelling with Poverty, “<i>in Tags and Rags</i>;”—as often
meet with Nobleness of Mind among the Humble in Fortune, as with those
who are by courtesy called Noble, and who are Poor enough in principle,
who wear a <span class="smcap">Velvet Gown</span>.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the Poor are, very naturally, as fond of flattery as
the Rich:—now nothing in nature Flatters more fascinatingly than the
Eye of a Dog! If his master speak to him in any tone lower than that of
Anger, his Eye is ever ready to ogle obsequious Approbation:—and if he
scold him, the rudest expression it ever offers is seeming to say, with
the most subtle submission, “As you are <i>Great</i>! be Merciful!”</p>

<p>In future, instead of the trite Old Adage, “As Faithful,” it
might more properly be said, “As Flattering as a Dog:”—like other
Flatterers, “<i>they are Faithless as they are Flattering</i>.”</p>

<p>Every one knows that when Men go Mad, they always hate most those that
they loved best when they were in their Senses: and it is a frightful
Truth, that</p>

<p>“<i>A Mad Dog is always apt to bite his Master first.</i>”</p>

<p>There have been many arguments <i>pro and con</i>, concerning the
dreadful Disease their bite produces;—it is enough to know, that
Multitudes of Men, Women, and Children, have died in consequence of
being bitten by Dogs.—What does it matter whether they were the
Victims of Bodily Disease or Mental Irritation? The Life of the
most humble Human Being is of more value than all the Dogs in the
World—dare the most brutal Cynic say otherwise?</p>

<p>Semi-drowning in the Sea, and all the pretended Specifics, are mere
delusions, and there is no real remedy but cutting the part out
immediately. If the bite be near a large Blood vessel, that cannot
always be done, nor when <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>done, nor however soon done, or however well
done, will it always prevent the miserable Victim from dying the most
dreadful of Deaths!!!</p>

<p class="noindent">Are formed of wrought Iron, and are the chief support of</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Carriage<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</i></p>

<p>Four Wheeled Carriages are divided into two parts, the <i>Upper</i> and
<i>Under Carriage</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Upper</i> is the main one, on which the Body is hung.</p>

<p><i>The Under Carriage</i> is the conductor, and is turned by means of
the Pole which acts on a centre-pin, called the <i>Perch Bolt</i>,
which goes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>through the fore Axle-tree bed and fore transom, and
secures the fore or under Carriage to the Upper one.</p>

<p>The Hind Wheels are placed on the <i>Upper</i>, the Fore Wheels on the
<i>Under Carriage</i>.</p>

<p>The utmost care should be taken to have every part made of good <i>Town
made Iron Work well wrought, and sound Wood well seasoned</i>, and of
sufficient strength, rather going to the extreme in thickness, than
risking the lives of the Passengers by the oversetting of the Carriage,
which often happens when an Axle-tree or a Perch, &amp;c. breaks.</p>

<p><i>The Common Axle-tree</i> is that which is in general use, it being
much the cheapest, a pair of the best case hardened costing only £9.
9<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>Collinge’s Axles</i> have many advantages, which more than
compensate the higher first charge for them, which is £28. 7<i>s.</i>,
but they wear so much longer, and the silent and steady motion they
preserve to the Wheels, and the convenience of retaining Oil enough to
travel a Journey of 30 Miles a day for 9 Months, that is, above 7,500
Miles, (<i>i. e.</i> if the Carriage does travel every day)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span> without
replenishing with Oil: the Common Axle will hardly travel 100 Miles
without requiring the Wheels to be taken off and greased.</p>

<p>In the ordinary Town Work—say, on an average, about 10 Miles a day,
Oiling twice a Year is enough: <span class="smcap">Mr. Collinge</span> sends a person to
do this, and charges 2<i>s.</i> for each Wheel; if a new Leather Washer
is wanted, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is charged for each: these are rarely
required oftener than once in nine months.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Wheels are much better secured, and the draught of the
Carriage is very much lessened.</p>

<p>Keep the <i>Winch</i> which fastens on the axle-cap in your own
possession, or some curious or clumsy person may unscrew it, and let
out the Oil.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Collinge’s Axles</span> are much more safe and secure, for they have
Two Collars and Two Nuts, which screw different ways, and a linch-Pin,
and a Cap which screws on over all.”—A. E.</p>

<p>A person who was formerly employed in Mr. Collinge’s Manufactory,
told me, that with all <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>the evident advantages of these Axle-trees,
they were not such general favourites with some Coachmen as might
be expected, which, for a long time, he could not any how account
for—till the unaccountable cause was accidentally discovered in the
two following instances.</p>

<p>A Coachman to a Gentleman who had Collinge’s Axles, was continually
abusing them, and at length got himself discharged:—the workman met
him some time after, and said, “Well, my Friend, I cannot imagine why
you were such a determined enemy to our Axles, which save you a vast
deal of Trouble, for they don’t need Oiling more than twice a Year; and
I cannot conceive why you preferred your Common Axles, which required
taking to pieces and greasing, &amp;c. once or twice in a Week! Now, as
you have left your place, and it cannot injure You, and may very
greatly serve Me, pray be so good as to tell me, why you so furiously
opposed our Axles?” “Why, sir,” replied Mr. Coachman, “the fact is,
that what you have stated as so great an advantage in your Axles, was
a great Dis-advantage to me: you know that my late Master, <i>Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>Rusticate</i>, used every week to go to his Country House, which is 30
miles from Town: this gave me an opportunity of charging him 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> for extra Grease, which did not cost me 2<i>d.</i>;
therefore, your Axles were a dead loss of £4. a year to me!!!”</p>

<p>He informed me that another unconquerable opponent was the servant of a
Gentleman who had a new Carriage every five years, and who gave the Old
one to his Coachman:—now, as Collinge’s Axles will wear out three or
four Carriages, they were taken away from the Old Carriage and put to
the New one,—which made it a less valuable perquisite to the Coachman
in the direct ratio of the worth of a set of Common Axles.</p>

<p>“<i>When you Build a Carriage, have Collinge’s Axles</i>;”—but
remember, it is not sufficient that you order the Builder to put
in <i>Patent Axles</i>, for some of the imitations of Collinge’s
Axles are called Patent Axles; and as they are got up cheap, some
Coachmakers, unless you positively desire them to go to <i>Collinge’s
Manufactory</i>, (near the Marsh-gate Turnpike, in the Westminster
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>Bridge Road), will, to put a pound in their own pocket, recommend the
<i>Sham Patents</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jervis</i> says, that he has actually seen them put down in
the Bill under the Appellation of, and charged at the Price of,
“<i>Collinge’s Patent Axles</i>.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p><h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WHEELS">THE WHEELS.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">


<p>The Work of a Carriage is proved by the wear of the Wheels;—if it
runs upon an average 10 miles per day in Town, and 15 in the Country,
Well-made Hoop-rimmed Wheels, the Tire of which should not be less than
five-eighths of an inch in thickness, and for a Travelling Carriage
three-fourths of an inch, will not be worn out in less than 12 Months,
<i>i. e.</i> they will run at least 3,650 Miles in Town, and it is
reckoned that they will last twice or thrice as long on a smooth Road,
as they will on rough Pavement.</p>

<p>It is said that <i>the Macadamising</i> of the Streets, if kept in
<i>perfect</i> Repair, would make the Wheels last a deal longer than
they did on the Pavement:—this operation is performed at present in
a very clumsy manner; instead of stopping up half the Street with a
Wooden Hoard, and breaking the Stones on the Spot, <i>the materials
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>should be brought there ready broken; One Twentieth part of the Time
now taken would then be more than enough entirely to finish a Road.</i></p>

<p><i>The Flag Foot Pavement</i> should also be brought ready chipped
and fitted;—by working the Stones in the Streets, the Eyes of the
Passengers are in no small danger.</p>

<p>By the Metropolis Street Act of the <i>57</i>th Geo. III. cap. xxix.
sec. lxiii. Every Occupier of any House, Warehouse, &amp;c. during the
continuance of Frost, or after or during the Fall of Snow, shall
once in every day, before 10 of the clock in the forenoon, cause the
Footway, all along the Front, Side, or Back walls of such House, &amp;c.
to be swept and cleansed;—for each neglect of doing so, to forfeit
10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>This order for keeping the Footway swept should be extended to all
Times and Seasons;—there is sometimes an accumulation of greasy dirt
on the pavement, which is as slippery as if it was soaped, and is as
dangerous as Ice itself:—might not this cleansing be done by poor from
the Workhouse?</p>

<p>In Walking the Streets of a Slippery Morning, you may guess where the
good-natured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>people live, by Sand or Ashes being thrown on the Ice
before their Doors.</p>

<p>How far the change of the permanent and easily kept clean Granite
Pavement, for the Mud and Dust of the present Roads, may be considered
an improvement by <i>the Eyes</i>, <i>the Legs</i>, <i>and the
Lungs</i> of our good Londoners, the Editor has not studied the subject
sufficiently to venture a conjecture: the Quiet with which Carriages
pass along is certainly extremely desirable to the Ears of the
Inhabitants of the Houses which border the Streets so altered.</p>

<p>Our Granite Pavement has shared the fate of every thing in this World,
where nothing remains long at rest: as soon as it had arrived at as
high a degree of perfection as it appeared capable of, it was pulled
up, and hammered into pieces:—so much for the Constancy and permanency
of Human Ways!</p>

<p>Some persons use their Carriage so little, and go so gently, that a set
of Strong Wheels will last them three or four Years: Others will be
whirled along at such a furious rate, that they wear them out in ten or
twelve Months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>When New Wheels are put on to Old Carriages, and <i>the Old Wheels</i>
are taken in exchange, the usual allowance for them is about two
Guineas per Set: but they are the perquisite of the Coachman if he has
been in your Service as long as the Wheels have.</p>

<p>From the beginning to the end, it will take not less than five Weeks
to finish a set of Wheels properly;—they should be made a fortnight
before they are painted, and they should not be put on for use till
a fortnight after they have been painted; therefore, order a set of
Wheels a couple of Months before they will be wanted.</p>

<p>The <i>Price of Four New Chariot Wheels</i> with prime Ash felleys, and
patent hoop tires, all of the very best workmanship, including every
charge of Painting and Boxing, &amp;c. is about £15.</p>

<p>A set of Wheels may be purchased for £12. 12<i>s.</i>: in the early
part of my Apprenticeship to Carriage-Keeping, I paid as high as £16.
16<i>s.</i></p>

<p><i>Watch the Tires.</i>—When the Irons are getting thin, have them
taken off, before they become too weak to protect the Wood-work:—the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>best plan is, <i>when the Irons are half worn out</i>, and before
the joints in the Wood-work get loose, as they wear most on the outer
edge, to have them taken off and turned;—if the Wood-work is sound,
they will run then half as long as they did at first; then, if the
Wood-work continues sound, have new Irons put on;—<i>the Ringing</i>
is about one-third the price of New Wheels, say £6. 6<i>s.</i>, and if
the Spokes and Naves are good, they will then run nearly as long as New
Wheels.</p>

<br>ORNAMENTS OF CARRIAGES,</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">If for common use, cannot be too simple and plain: Expense is saved in
the purchase, and Time in the cleaning;—it is not so much the Quantity
of furniture about the Carriage and Harness that makes it appear to
advantage, as the having what there is, kept nicely Clean and Bright.</p>

<p>I would not advise any Brass or Plated Beading on the Body of a
Carriage, as in the rubbing it bright, you are very apt to rub off the
Varnish and Paint contiguous to the moulding—which, for this reason,
had better be painted black, or of the same colour as the Body.</p>

<p><i>The Key-hole of the Lock</i> on the Carriage Door is sometimes of
Brass, or Plated, and covered with a Plate; but it is much neater to
have it Black;—as we have already observed, of all Ornaments attached
to the Body, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>as often as they are cleaned, some of the Varnish and
Paint is carried away, and in the same proportion that those Metallic
additions are kept bright, the Body becomes blemished. For this reason,
we recommend <i>the Accommodation Handles</i>, if any are fixed, (the
Body looks infinitely more elegant without), to be Black.</p>

<p>Those <i>Buckles</i>, &amp;c. are best formed for wear that have fewest
sharp edges;—Round moulded furniture is also the cheapest.</p>

<p>Nothing varies in quality more than <i>the Plated Furniture</i> for
Horses and Carriages—the inferior kind of Plating is cheaper than
Brass, but at first looks as well as the best strong plating, which
costs twice as much, although it will not wear half so long.</p>

<p>The making of <i>Lamps for Carriages</i> is a distinct branch of
business—and those who are desirous of choosing for themselves, should
ask their Coachmaker to attend them to his Lamp Maker, where they may
see the various patterns which are in vogue.</p>

<p>The same with regard to <i>the Door Handles</i>.</p>

<p>There are several Shops for both these Articles in Long Acre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>The present fashion for Lamps is preposterous—many are made so large
and so heavy, that they are evidently too great a Load on the Front
Pillar of the Carriage. Have <i>Square Lamps</i>, about six inches
square:—these are sufficiently large to hold air enough to feed the
Lamp or Candle, and the less they are, the lighter they are, and the
less injury they do to the Carriage Pillars:—Two sides of this Lamp
are to be of Glass, and the others furnished with Reflectors, which
will increase the light on the Road, and exclude it from the interior
of the Carriage.</p>

<p><i>Circular Lamps</i> are the most elegant; but if your Carriage is
much used in Travelling, we must recommend <i>the Square sort</i>;
because if a Square Glass is broken, it can be replaced easily,
and costs not one-half so much as a Circular one, which it is also
difficult to find, except at the place where the Lamp was bought;
moreover, they seldom fit so nicely and so closely as the Square ones,
and the Air rushing in, your Candles are quickly consumed, without any
additional light being given.</p>

<p>Lamps are generally lighted by <i>Wax Candles</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>which weigh each a
quarter of a Pound, and cost about 1<i>s.</i> each: if the Lamp is well
made and well glazed, and no air gets in except where the air-holes
are, they will burn about five hours: such Candles will burn about 7½
Hours when still in a Room; but the motion of the Carriage, and the
current of Air in the Lamp, so greatly accelerates their consumption,
that they will sometimes flare away in three or four hours.</p>

<p><i>Lamps with two Flat Wicks</i> will burn for the same time as a
quarter of a pound Wax Candle, at one-fourth part the expense.</p>

<p>However, <i>Candles</i> are most commonly used, because they remain
ready for immediate use for half a year together, without being
injured in quality, but will burn as brightly as if only put in the
day before:—<i>Oil</i> soon loses its spirit by remaining in Lamps;
and in a little time it will hardly burn at all, therefore can only be
recommended to those who use their Lamps and trim them carefully every
day.</p>

<p><i>The Best Lamps</i> are those which give plenty of light around the
Carriage, but do not throw any into it,—unless the Passengers think
there <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>is an absolute necessity for letting those without see who are
within.</p>

<p>Now the Streets are so well lighted, <i>Lamps are useful in London only
in Foggy Weather</i>: the lighting them in London at any other time—is
an act of Puerile Pomposity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Springs</span> should be made of the best Steel—the longer they are,
<i>ceteris paribus</i>, the easier they are.</p>

<p>Improvements in the mechanism of Modern Carriages, by which they are
made to convey a person from place to place almost without giving him a
sense of motion, may be one of the circumstances that have contributed
to the increased prevalence of Nervous and Bilious Complaints,
which originate in a great degree from an indulgence in Lassitude
and Languor. The notion of taking <i>Exercise</i> upon Springs of
such construction, is scarcely less absurd, than that of taking an
<i>Airing</i> with all the windows closed!</p>

<p>Valetudinarians who wish to derive all the good effects from the
Exercise of riding in a Carriage, must not be super-curious about
having it suspended on extremely elastic Springs. The Jolting of strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>Springs is a salutary concussion, which is extremely convenient to
Nervous, Indolent, and Infirm persons who do not take other Exercise,
and must be classed among the most agreeable of Anti-bilious remedies.</p>

<p>The Coachmaker’s usual phrase of commendation—that such a Carriage
“is as easy as a Boat,” should be a prohibition to Invalids against
purchasing it; who should prefer a Carriage with Strong Springs, that
will give them as good a shaking as Equestrian Agitation.</p>


<p class="center p2">TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF LONG AND SHORT CARRIAGES,</p>

<p>“A weight of <i>twenty-eight pounds</i> was placed in the middle of a
<i>Perch one foot six inches long</i>, and it was drawn at the rate of
five miles and a half an hour by twelve pounds.</p>

<p>“When the same load was placed upon a perch three feet long, that is to
say, <i>twice as long as the former perch</i>, it required <i>precisely
the same weight of twelve pounds to draw it</i>.</p>

<p>“This experiment was repeated a number of times with the same result,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>so that it may be relied upon. This is contrary to the opinion of
drivers of all descriptions, from the waggoner in his smock-frock, to
the high-bred Coachman: consequently, there must be some reason for
this universal prejudice. The reason that seems to have given rise to
this opinion, is, that carriages whose fore and hind wheels are near
each other, extricate themselves more readily from ruts, change quarter
more easily, turn in a shorter compass, and thus make their way in
crowded Streets with more facility than longer Carriages.”—<i>R. L.
Edgeworth on Roads and Carriages</i>, 8vo. p. 120. 1817.</p>

<p>However, <i>Short Carriages</i> are considered as of easiest draught;
and, to use the language of the Stable, almost every Coachman and
Coachmaker insists upon it, that they <i>follow better</i>, and that a
Long Carriage will tire a pair of Horses more in <i>Three</i>, than a
Short one will in Five hours’ Travelling.</p>

<p>That if the Body is hung higher behind than it is before, so that it
leans forward, it will push on the fore Wheels, is a foolish Vulgar
Error. You often see Hackney Chariots so hung:—such a position is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>uneasy to the Passengers, and of no advantage to the Horses.</p>

<p>In a Chariot, it adds to the elegance of its appearance, and the ease
of the passengers, if the Body is hung rather lower behind than it is
before; but not in a Coach, because what is gained on the front is lost
on the back Seat.</p>

<p>Let no person venture to purchase without the advice of a Coachmaker.
It is easy enough to make an old worn-out Carriage appear fresh and
fair by the help of Paint and Putty, while at the same time, it may be
more fit to be broken up than to be made use of.</p>

<p>To promote the Sale of a Carriage, it is not seldom pretended, that it
belongs to <i>Sir Richard Whimmy</i>, or to some other Gentleman of
fashion, (who only parts with it merely because he happens to have it,)
or that the Proprietor is gone abroad; to which is generally added, it
has been only lately built, and has hardly worn the Nails of its First
Wheels!!! &amp;c.</p>

<p>First observe the Fashion of the Body, keeping in mind the time when
such a shape was in vogue; examine the materials, especially the
timbers of the Carriage; for however cunningly a clever Coach-Cobbler
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>may have puttied and painted them, yet, in some parts, the infirmities
and chinks which time has made, will be visible enough to Eyes
accustomed to examine them.</p>

<p>If Old, the <i>Futchells</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> in the chaps at the Pole Bolt hole,
and at the top where the Gib is placed, are rough and patched with
Leather; the Pole<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> if the original one, on the sides and top which
go into the Futchells, is likewise worn, and patched with a tin
covering. Look to <i>the Transom Plates</i>, if they are flat, thick,
and clean, and that if by pushing against the Coach Box, or Springs,
the Upper Carriage does not rock on them;—see that the <i>Fore
Axle-tree Bed</i>, and transom at the middle where the Perch Bolt is
placed, are sound, and that about the Perch Bolt hole there is not much
patching with Leather—that the ends of the Transom where the Springs
and Coach Box is placed look clean and sound;—<i>the Splinter Bar</i>,
if much worn, has the moulding towards the end nearly effaced;—<i>the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>Sway Bar</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and that part of the bottom plate of the perch
against which it wears, after much use is gulled, and the defect is
made up with Leather patched on it;—the ends of the hind Axle-tree Bed
where the Spring stays rest, if much indented, is old:—the hind Foot
board-ledge being worn hollow, is another proof of the Carriage having
been much used.</p>

<p>As to <i>the Body</i> part, examine principally the Bottom sides, at
the end where the loops are placed; and in the corners of the rabbits
under the Door bottoms where the standing Pillars are framed, if very
old they will be rotten and appear rough; the mortices of the Door
Locks, if gulled, and the Bolts of the Lock if loose in the Spindles,
are proofs of their being old; and so it is if the Leather which covers
the Roof of the Quarters and Boot, appear to have been mended at the
welts, or if it has drawn from the sewings or nailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p><i>The Braces</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> should be supple and clean, free from patches
and cracks at the bearings;—the <i>Steps</i>, if ricketty at the
Joints, and when down, if the tread drops under, and the leather with
which they are trimmed is dingy and torn at the joint knuckles; this
shews them to have been much used: the leather also which covers the
bottom sides at the entrance of the Doors, if Old, is rough, and has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>the grain worn or torn on the outside.</p>

<p>The Mahogany or Venetian Blind Frames, when old, have their colour
discharged by the weather, and look of a dingy brown;—the Glass
frames, particularly the front ones, are, when old, loose at the
corners, the sides of the grooves loosened, and held together only by
the Cloth which covers them.</p>

<p>Nothing is a better proof than the mouldings of the framings, and the
Scroll ends or finishings of the timber; for if much filled with Paint,
or defaced, it is a certain Proof of the Carriage having been often
painted, and of course old; the paint will, with a slight knock, if not
newly done, fly off in scales, particularly from the Iron work.</p>

<p>Examine well those places in the Body round the edges, if the framing
where the wet has been likely to lodge has not been rotten, and the
surface is not made up with Putty, or has been cased on the outside
with new pieces of Wood moulding.</p>

<p>Examine <i>the Cloth of the Lining</i>, observe the sides and back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>against which the Shoulders rub, that the cloth is not threadbare, and
that it is free from Moth-holes in every part.</p>

<p>The Hand Holders and pasting Lace, particularly the small Lace which is
round the Lights or Windows.</p>

<p>If the Carriage has a Coach Box, examine the condition of the Seat
under the Hammercloth at the ends and corners on the inside; if it has
been much used, it will be ragged and worn through in many places.</p>

<p>In examining the <i>Wheels</i>, look not only to the outside edge
of the Iron which covers them, but also to the Spokes at the Nave,
that they are not started, and that the Wheels are firm on the
Axle-trees.—These are the General Rules to be observed when examining
a Second-Hand Carriage.</p>

<p><i>Never buy without advice from some skilful and disinterested
person.</i></p>

<hr class="r5">


<p>From decayed Harness, almost as much danger is to be dreaded as from a
faulty Carriage. However skilful the Coachman, if your Harness fails,
how can he manage his Horses?</p>

<p>That Harness may not be used so long as to become expensive and
troublesome in the repair, we will endeavour to give some guide as to
<i>how long it may be expected to last</i>: this, however, depends much
on the Quality of the Leather and the Goodness of the Workmanship, the
Weather it is exposed to, and the care that is taken of it.</p>

<p>Harness perishes with hanging by; and however moderately it may be
used, after five or six years is seldom fit for further service, unless
very extraordinary care has been taken to preserve it. It may be said
to wear in proportion to the Work done with it: this is ascertained by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>the number of Wheels worn out, and we calculate that it will last in
London, at least, as long as Four Sets of Wheels.</p>

<p>Harness for common work should not be encumbered with superfluous
Ornaments, &amp;c.: the plainer it is the better. The less the Horse is
burdened with trappings, the more easily he can do his Work;—the less
Time is required to keep it clean;—and the less Money it costs.</p>

<p>Those who are nice about the look of their Harness, must keep a set
of Old Harness for Wet Weather and Night Work; which is a plan to be
recommended to all Persons who make much use of their Carriage.</p>

<p>A Handsome set of Chariot Harness, of the very best Workmanship, with
patent Leather Waterdecks, according to Estimate (No. 9), costs from
about £30. to £36.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>Observe the condition of the Leather; if it is soft and pliable, it
is good:—if dry and stiff, it is bad. This is also the case if the
Grain is cracked, or if the Sewings are gummed up with grease, and the
veined marks on the edges are effaced. See that all the Leathers at the
buckling and looped parts are whole and perfect;—the trace ends, the
collars, the cruppers, the belly bands, and billets, shew best at the
buckling parts how much the Harness has been used.</p>

<p>The Furniture (except the Ornaments) usually remains longer perfect
than the Leather does, but look to the corners of the Buckles and Rings
of the Territs through which the Reins pass, and to the Ornaments;
likewise the inside Winker-pieces and the head chains; these are the
likeliest parts to look to for a proof of the Furniture, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>Leather is the best guide, for if the pipes and ley of the Collars,
traces at the points, and the breeching at the straps, are perfect, the
Harness is likely to be a good one, though <i>a Second-Hand Harness
seldom proves</i> (after the expense of alterations and changing the
Ornaments, which necessarily must be done before it can be used) <i>to
be so Cheap, in the long run, as a New one</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Should not be hung higher than Three feet from the ground, should have
strong well-seasoned Springs, which should be corded, and every part of
it should be much stronger than a Town Carriage. Bolts inside should be
attached to the Doors, to prevent their being opened on the outside.</p>

<p>The Dickey Box should have <i>Pistol Holsters</i> on each side, covered
with black fur tops.</p>

<p>A front Budget attached to the Body, or fixed on the beds of Carriage.</p>

<p><i>A hind Rumble</i> for two servants, with knee boot attached to the
Body.</p>

<p><i>Cap Case</i> to front of Body.</p>

<p><i>Trunks for Travelling</i> must be very strong, and strengthened
at the corners with Iron Plates, and should have Inside Straps and
Laths; these are conveniences to confine what the trunk contains from
shifting about; they are made with four or five laths covered with
cloth or paper, which are nailed, at a small distance from each other,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>to three pieces of girth web, and lie at the top of the parcels within
the trunk; on the bottom of the trunks straps are nailed, which buckle
round the laths and keep all tight.</p>


<p class="center">TRUNK COVERS</p>

<p class="noindent">are made to fit the outside of the trunks, to cover and preserve them
from the weather; they are usually made of thick painted cloth, with
holes at the sides, for the handles of the trunk to be got at.</p>


<p class="center">IMPERIALS,</p>

<p class="noindent">are large flat cases made to the form of the whole or part of the Roof
or Body; they are conveniences to carry light articles safe, mostly
designed for wearing Apparel; they are made of thin boards, covered
with Leather, and lined with tow and baize: to prevent its rubbing
the roof, if intended to cover the whole of the roof, they are most
convenient to remove, if divided into, two parts; and as the half is
often sufficient for use, it saves unnecessary luggage. They are fixed
on the Roof by means of straps and staples.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p class="center">DRAG CHAIN, SHOE, AND STAFF,</p>

<p class="noindent">are necessary to every Travelling Carriage: the Chain is to lock the
Wheels, and to prevent the going too fast downhill; the Staff is to
stop the Carriage, and give rest to the Horses, when ascending a hill;
the chain is fixed to a hook about the middle of the perch or crane,
with a hook or shoe at the end for the Wheels. The Hook is most handy
for use, but the shoe is preferable, as it preserves the Iron of the
Wheel from Injury when dragging on hard stony ground. The Chain being
covered with Leather prevents it from rattling.</p>


<p class="center">OIL-SKIN COVERS TO THE BODY</p>

<p class="noindent">preserve the Paint from the injury of the Road dirt, or Boughs, while
Travelling: these covers are frequently used, and are so made that
the Doors may be opened and shut with them on. Every part of the Body
except the Windows and bottom is covered; it is looped on to the Body
by small buttons, and is put on and off with the utmost facility: they
are made of common oiled linen, lined with soft baize.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p class="center">SPRING CORDING.</p>

<p>Springs are corded to prevent danger and delay, if by accident a plate
should break, and also to strengthen them, especially when Carriages
are loaded with heavy Imperials and much Luggage: it is done by placing
a thin piece of ash or a length of cord along the back, and afterwards
twisting a small but strong cord round, and fastening it well at the
top.</p>


<p class="center">SAFETY BRACES</p>

<p class="noindent">are fixed by strong Braces attached to the C springs, passing directly
under the bottom of the Body, (and prevent any stopping on the road by
the springs breaking or body-loops giving way), the expense of which,
with the fixing and check-loops, is 5 Guineas; the length varying from
nine to twelve feet, according to the length of the Carriage.</p>

<br>TRAVELLING CHARIOT,</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">of which the following description may furnish hints to those who wish
to have a convenient Carriage.</p>

<p>The very curious and convenient Chariot of the late Emperor of
France, which I examined when it was exhibited at the London Museum,
Piccadilly, in 1816, was built by Symons of Brussels, for the Russian
Campaign, and was adapted to the various purposes of a <i>Pantry</i>
and of a <i>Kitchen</i>; for it had places for holding and preparing
refreshments, which, by the aid of a Lamp, could be heated in the
Carriage; it served also for <i>a Bed Room</i>, <i>a Dressing Room</i>,
<i>an Office</i>, &amp;c.;—there was a separation rising about six
inches, dividing the Seat. The exterior of this ingenious vehicle was
of the form and dimensions of our large Modern English Travelling
Chariot—only that it had a projection in front of about two feet, the
right-hand half of which was open to the inside to receive the feet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>and thus formed a Bed—the left-hand contained a store of various
useful things.</p>

<p>Beyond the projection in front, and nearer to the Horses, was the seat
for the Coachman, ingeniously contrived so as to prevent the Driver
from viewing the interior of the Carriage, and yet so placed as to
afford those within a clear sight of the Horses and of the surrounding
Country:—beneath this seat was a receptacle for a Box, about 2½ feet
in length and 4 inches square, which contained a Bedstead of polished
Steel, which could be fitted up in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Over the Front Windows was a <i>Roller Blind</i> of strong painted
Canvass, which, when pulled out, <i>excluded Rain, while it admitted
Air</i>: we wonder this is not an universal appendage to every Chariot
in this Country.</p>

<p>On the Ceiling of the Carriage was a Net work for carrying small
travelling requisites: in a recess there was a Sécrétaire 10 inches
square by 18 inches in length, which contained nearly an hundred
articles presented to Napoleon by Maria Louisa, under whose care it was
fitted up with every luxury and convenience that could be imagined,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>and contained, besides the usual requisites for a Dressing-Box, most
of which were of solid Gold,—a magnificent Breakfast service, with
Plates—Candlesticks—Knives—Forks—Spoons—a spirit Lamp, for making
Breakfast in the Carriage—Gold Case for Napoleons—Gold Wash-hand
Basin—variety of Essence Bottles, Perfumes—and an almost infinite
variety of minute articles, down to Pins, Needles, Thread, and Silk.
Each of these were fitted into recesses, most ingeniously contrived,
and made in the solid Wood, in which they packed close together, and
many within each other, in so small a compass, that, on seeing them
arranged, it appeared impossible for them ever to be put in so small
a compass:—at the bottom of this Toilette Box, in divided recesses,
were found Two Thousand Gold Napoleons;—on the Top, Writing Materials,
Looking Glass, Combs, &amp;c.—a Liqueur Case which had Two Bottles, one
with Malaga Wine, the other Rum,—a silver Sandwich Box, containing a
Plate, Knives, Spoons, Pepper and Salt Boxes, Mustard Pot, Decanter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Glasses, &amp;c.—a Wardrobe, Writing-Desk, Maps, Telescopes, Arms,
&amp;c.—a large silver Chronometer, by which the Watches of the Army were
regulated, two Merino Mattresses, a Green Velvet Travelling Cap—also a
diamond Headdress (tiara), Hat, Sword, Uniform, and an Imperial Mantle,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>same Officers that collect the House and Window Taxes; and are
reckoned from one fifth of April to another; and if you keep a Horse or
Carriage for a Single week, you must pay the Tax thereon for a whole
Year.</p>

MANAGING COACHMEN.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">
<p>The Christian precept of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“<i>Do as you would be done by</i>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is in few instances more difficult to observe, than it is towards a
Coachman, who is, in fact, paid to endure those Inconveniences from
which the Carriage protects his Employer. However, the Good Master will
“<i>do as he would be done by</i>,” and make his Servant as Comfortable
as the peculiar nature of his place permits.</p>

<p><i>Merciful Masters</i>, who use their Carriage in Wet Weather<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>,
provide their Coachman <i>Two Box Coats</i>:—a Second-hand Coat may be
bought for about £2. 10<i>s.</i>—a slight increase to their Expense, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>great addition to his Comfort: for when <i>a Box Coat gets thoroughly
Wet, it will take forty-eight hours before it becomes thoroughly
Dry</i>; for it must not be dried otherwise than gradually and in the
Air. <i>Mr. Jarvis</i> says, that “the best way of drying a Box Coat on
these occasions, is to put it round a Truss of Straw.”</p>

<p>The Hardy habits of Coachmen enable them to brave the inclemencies of
the Sky, and to set the Cold and Rain at defiance, when encompassed
in their seven-fold Cape, and a comfortable <i>Dry Coat</i>;—but, my
fair-weather friend, can you imagine a more awfully dangerous envelope
than <i>a Wet Blanket</i>?</p>

<p>Whatever Olympic Wits or Whips might think, there are few modern
Jockies who will agree with Pindarus, that Water is the best thing, at
least for the lining of the <i>Inner</i> or the <i>Outer Coat</i> of
the Stomach.</p>

<p><i>Damp Clothes</i> are the cause of Coachmen being so often and so
severely afflicted with Rheumatism; therefore we insert the following,
which has frequently proved an efficacious remedy in old and inveterate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>attacks of this complaint.</p>

<div class="blockquot" style="max-width:40em">

<p class="center"><i>Anti-Rheumatic Embrocation.</i></p>

<ul>
<li>Sal Volatile, an ounce and a half;</li>

<p>Mix—rub the part afflicted Night and Morning, and in the
Middle of the Day.</p>
</div>

<p>The Reader may have observed, that the Coach Box of the Carriages of
many Medical Men is furnished with a <i>Knee Boot</i>, <i>i. e.</i>
an Apron like that of a Gig:—this is a comfortable, and, indeed, a
needful defence to the Legs and Feet. The Author advises the general
adoption thereof to those who use their Carriage much in Cold Wet
Weather, and especially recommends it to those Genteel<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> people, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>courageously keep their Servants and Horses in waiting half the Night,
in bitter cold weather, while they are indulging themselves in the
opposite extreme of temperature in Crowded Assemblies.</p>

<p>No <i>Entertainments</i> (as those <i>Midnight Inflictions</i> are by
courtesy termed), afford so little satisfaction as</p>


<p class="center p2">EVENING PARTIES.</p>

<p>All who know you, that <i>are not</i> invited, will take umbrage, and
half of those who <i>are</i>, receive the intended Compliment only as
their due, and not seldom return it by ridiculing their Host, who, if
he is prudent, they will censure for his Parsimony; if he be generous,
will rate as a Prodigal.</p>

<p>These (foolish, if they are poor, but if Rich, wicked,)
“<i>Fly-by-Nights</i>,”</p>

entitled to pass for folks of exquisite Fashion, in proportion to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>degree of fondness that they pretend to exhibit for being Stewed in
foul Air<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>.</p>

<p>As <i>Sir Exquisite Irritable</i> says, “Nothing can be less Nice than
the Re-respiration of <i>Respired Air</i>, every whif of which has just
popped out of the Mouth of another! To Drink out of the same Cup, is
comparatively an act of delectable Refinement!!!”</p>

<p>What is to be said <span class="allsmcap">FOR</span> the Absurdity of not going out to an
<i>Evening</i> Party, until You ought to be going into Your Bed? Every
Body has enough to say <span class="allsmcap">AGAINST</span> it! But, nevertheless, the
very persons who exclaim loudest against this foolish Fashion, are
frequently found among the foremost of those who follow it.—How comes
this? why, this is quite inconceivable!—No, indeed,—No!—pray pardon
me—with the utmost submission, it is among the strange things which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>are very easily accounted for—<i>it is Fashionable! it is extremely
Genteel!!</i></p>

<p>However, these <i>Midnight Meetings</i>, under the inviting appellation
of <span class="smcap">Genteel</span> <i>Evening Parties</i>, are, in fact, a
<i>Barbarous Invention of the Idle and Imbecile</i>, to undermine the
Constitution, and annihilate the Independence of the Industrious and
the Healthful.</p>

<p>The noisy announcement of the arrival of the Visitors at these
Nocturnal Assemblies, by the absurd custom of a Thundering Rapping at
the Door, which is already open, is one of the most ridiculous customs
of modern times, and should be entirely abolished.—If a parcel of
silly people are permitted to meet together at Midnight, they ought not
to be permitted to murder the Sleep of their surrounding neighbours,
from Ten at Night till Three in the Morning! It is as disorderly
an offence against the public peace as can be mentioned; and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>if
it happened at the house of a poor person, it would be immediately
indicted as Disorderly.</p>

<p>Good Nature may find some Excuse for the Poor and Dependent, who
(perhaps very unwillingly) are obliged to follow a Foolish Fashion; but
what apology can Good Sense invent for the Opulent and the Independent,
who are the Makers of Manners, and who set a Foolish Example<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>.</p>

<p>The Writer does not presume further, than humbly to advise those who
wish to enjoy any of their faculties in perfection, not willingly to
refrain from wearing their <span class="smcap">Night Cap</span>, <i>Later than Eleven
o’Clock at Night</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">One</span> <i>Hour’s Sleep before Twelve o’Clock is worth</i>
<span class="smcap">Two</span> <i>after</i>.”</p>

<p>Do you recollect, Gentle Reader, to have ever learned any thing worth
remembering</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">After Eleven o’Clock at Night?</span><br>
</p>

<p>I don’t:—nor, indeed, <i>for a full Hour before that time</i>,—those
persons whose bodies or minds have been industriously employed during
the day, are arrived at that degree of exhaustion, that their faculties
are become obtuse;—if you ask them any thing, “they don’t know;”—and
if you tell them any thing, “they don’t care.”</p>

<p><i>Midnight Conversation</i> cannot be any thing more than a mere
“<i>caput mortuum</i>,” and the vapid draining of Brains collapsed by
the continued cogitations of the 14 or 15 preceding Hours!—or the
unwholesome effervescence of the “hot and rebellious liquors” which
have been taken to revive the flagging spirits.</p>

<p><i>The Machinery of Man</i>, like the wheels of a Watch, after a
certain time wants winding up, or it will go down—when this time
comes, till your Gentleman is wound up by Food and Rest, he cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>talk, any better than that can tick, till that is wound up again.</p>

<p>To the person who is intrusted with so important a concern as the
management of your Carriage and Horses you will do wisely to give
proper encouragement: on his Honesty and Judgment greatly depend the
safety of the Rider and the Expense of the Equipage—therefore, it is
as much your Interest to be kind, as it is his Duty to be Careful.</p>

<p>It will be well, therefore, to put your Coachman beyond any petty
temptations from Hackneymen, Horsedealers, Farriers, Coachmakers,
<i>et id genus omne</i>, and pay him cheerfully all such reasonable
Perquisites as will make it His Interest to take care of Yours.</p>

<p>People are often biassed by their Coachman in what is to be done in the
Repair or alteration of their Carriage and Horses, and from interested
motives, or capricious whims, the Knights of the Whip, it is said,
sometimes have gone to extravagant lengths, and the Carriage has
become rather the Property of the Coachman and Coachmaker, than of the
Proprietor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>A careful Coachman is a valuable Servant. “A Coachman,” says the
<i>Sieur Soleysell</i>, “should be skilful, Nimble, Hardy, and
Honest, should love Horses, and have a desire to perform all his work
well:—when a Master findeth a Lad with these qualities, he should not
easily part with him; for this Merchandise, although Clownish, is hard
enough to be found.”—See his <i>Complete Horseman</i>, folio, p. 145,
1717.</p>

<p>To the above Qualifications, must be added, that of Reading and
Writing; and if you reside in London, that of “knowing Town well,”
<i>i. e.</i> be well acquainted with the situation, the distance, and
the best Roads, (as they may now be called) to the various parts of
that amazing Labyrinth of Lanes called London.</p>

<p><i>Before you permit him to mount the Box</i>—ask him how far it is to
half a dozen different places in opposite directions, and which Way he
would go, and how Long he would be in driving you thither.</p>

<p>The best Age for a Coachman is between 30 and 40—before the former,
they are perfunctory, and soon after the latter, they lack Activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>The following maxim, which I gave for hiring a Cook, applies as aptly
to engaging Coachmen.</p>

<p>Before the age of <span class="smcap">Thirty</span>, however comfortable you may
endeavour to make them, their want of experience, and the Hope of
something still <i>better</i>, prevents their being content with their
present state.</p>

<p>After they have had the benefit of Experience, if they are tolerably
comfortable, they will endeavour to deserve the approbation of even
a moderately kind Master, for <i>Fear</i> they may change for the
<i>worse</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“The Good that they wish for, mayn’t match what they’ve got;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And therefore they’d best be content with their lot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Life is divided into the Seasons of <span class="smcap">Hope</span>, and <span class="smcap">Fear</span>.
In <span class="smcap">Youth</span> <i>we hope that every thing may be right</i>;—In
<span class="smcap">Age</span>, <i>we fear that every thing will be wrong</i>.</p>

<p>Whether you have your own Horses, or Hire of a Hackneyman:—<i>Mr.
Jarvis</i> begs you to be very careful in choosing a Coachman, or you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>may get for a Charioteer, an ignorant, careless creature, who hardly
knows</p>

<p><i>The best Person to apply to, to recommend a Coachman</i>, is the
Hackneyman of whom you Hire your Horses; it is his own Interest to
recommend a Servant who is capable and careful: or by looking in the
Daily papers, you will find many who are in want of places:—The
shortest way, is to advertise for one—this will bring plenty of
applicants presently—direct them to call on your Hackneyman, or to
some person on whom you can depend, and let him select and send to you
only such as he thinks likely to suit: this will save you much time and
trouble: moreover, it is desirable that a Coachman should be in some
degree dependant upon the person of whom you hire Horses, that he may
be accountable to him for the proper treatment of them, and you will
thus be better served.</p>

<p>Accept of no <i>Written Character</i> when any other can be obtained;
and it is the most satisfactory plan for all Parties, to <i>Give, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>Receive the Character of a Servant in the presence of such Servant.</i></p>

<p>The common custom, is for the Coachman to come for</p>


<p class="center p2">ORDERS</p>

<p class="noindent">at a certain hour. Very well,—tell him “to stay at Home, and be ready
to attend to your Business,” adding, however, (if you expect him to do
so) that “whenever you wish for a Half, or a whole Holiday for your
own Business,”—for every one has Business and Desires, such as they
are,—“ask me for it, and I will not Dissappoint you, even though your
Absence may be Inconvenient—Mark!—Mind my Business, and I promise
you, that I will never prevent your having every reasonable opportunity
of minding Your own:”—make an agreement with him, that he shall
have certain Hours in certain Days for such business as the Horses,
Carriage, &amp;c. require.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Leave is Light;”</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="noindent">and warn him that if you find him out without leave, at any other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>time—you will immediately give him leave of Absence from your service
for ever after, and that it will become your Duty, to state the reason
why you do so, to any person who may apply for his Character.</p>

<p>Desire him, <i>Five minutes before he brings the Carriage round</i>,
to open the Windows and ventilate it: even in Winter, <i>Cold</i> Air
is not so offensive as <i>Confined</i> Air—desire him to bring the
Carriage with the Glasses and Blinds, &amp;c. in the position in which you
generally use them; and when you tell him at what Time to come, <i>tell
him which Way to bring his Horses’ heads to the Door</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
East or West, so that he may start at once, without the disagreeable
trouble of turning about—give him similar directions when you stop
any where, and apprise him, that when you get in again, if you don’t
immediately direct him otherwise, he is always to take you towards Home.</p>

<p><i>Finally</i>, let his General Business be given to him in Writing;
<i>i. e.</i> at what Hours you most usually want the Carriage—how Long
at a time you are generally out—what Pace you wish to go—and what
Roads to particular places, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>Give <i>him a Map of London</i>, on which, mark with Red Ink the way
you wish to be taken to those places to which you are most frequently
going—and tell him, if you order him to take you to any place, the way
to which he is not well acquainted with, always to say so plainly, and
you will direct him.</p>

<p>Some Good Masters never (unless in a case of necessity) take their
Carriage out on a <i>Sunday</i>.</p>

<p>In well-governed Families, every Servant has the liberty every
<i>Sunday</i> of going once to Church; which if they neglect, and fail
in their duty to their Maker, they may well be suspected of failing
in their duty to their master:—<i>A Person who goes regularly to
Church</i>, will be <span class="smcap">Well</span> spoken of, though he may have no
other merit to recommend him: He who neglects that Duty is <span class="smcap">Ill</span>
spoken of, if he has no other Fault, and has every other Virtue.</p>

<p>Whenever you find it necessary to give any Directions, or to reprove
him for Neglect, &amp;c., never send any Message to him by another
Servant,—mention it yourself; You may do this with much more effect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>than you can by any deputy, who, through Mistake or Ill-nature, may
likely enough either say more or less than you told him.</p>

<p>Never reprove Servants unless you are quite in a Good Temper; the best
way to ensure which, is,—<i>Never to Lecture them, till at least
<span class="antiqua"><span class="smcap">One Day after</span></span> they have offended you.</i></p>

<p>Never forget to Commend them when they are Right; nothing can cherish
the desire of pleasing in Them so effectually, as to shew them that
you are pleased:—it is a much pleasanter, and a more effectual mode
of proceeding, to <i>Praise</i> them into good conduct, than to
<i>Scold</i> them out of bad.</p>

<p>There is a Perversity in poor human nature which sets itself against
Correction, and is restive to reproof, but is pliant and yielding to
the least expression of Kindness. <i>Pride</i> is like the Rust that
seizes and stiffens the Spring of an Engine, and checks its motion,
so that no force can set it to work; but <i>Kindness</i> is like Oil,
which smooths the machinery in such a manner that the parts move almost
of themselves. This Gentle method of dealing with our fellow-creatures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>is <span class="smcap">God’s</span> own method of dealing with mankind, who “delighteth
not in the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he should turn from his
Wickedness and Live;” and chooses rather to lead us to Repentance by
his Goodness, than to drive us to it by his Wrath.</p>

<p class="noindent">In a Coachman is indispensable,—if he has 15 or 20 Minutes’ notice
that he will be wanted, there is no excuse for his not being ready by
that time; for a regular Coachman gets his Harness and Carriage clean
and ready to put to, early in the day.</p>

<p>In establishments where it is not known at what hour a Carriage will be
wanted, but when it is, is wanted at a minute’s notice, the Horses are
kept ready Harnessed.</p>

<p>Desire him always to be at your Door, <i>Five Minutes before</i>
the time he is ordered, especially <i>when ordered at an unusual
hour</i>;—when you are going out “on actual Service,” his being ready
at the desired moment, is infinitely more important than when you are
going out at the usual hour merely for Amusement. One Minute of Your
Time, is often worth an Hour of His.</p>

<p>Tell your Coachman, that “<span class="smcap">The Oracle</span> <i>has declared</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>that—He who sometimes comes <i>Before</i> the time he is ordered,
manifests respect for his Employers and a laudable Anxiety to obey
Orders.</p>

<p>“He who never comes till <i>the Last Moment</i>, presents presumptive
evidence that he is disposed to do no more work than he is obliged to
do.</p>

<p>“He who comes <i>After</i> the Time, would not come then, unless Fear
flogged him:</p>

<p>“Encourage the First,</p>

<p>“Endure the Second,</p>

<p>“Do as you like with the Last.”</p>

<p>One Friend informed me that he cured an excellent Coachman of his
neglect of being punctual (which was the only fault he had)—by hiring
a Hackney Coach, whenever his own Carriage was not at the Door to a
minute, and deducting the charge thereof from his Wages. Another makes
it part of the Agreement, in hiring a Coachman, that he shall forfeit a
Shilling for every Minute he comes after the time he is ordered.</p>

<p>Remember <i>Tom Thrifty’s</i> account of that excellent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>Disciplinarian, old Admiral <span class="smcap">Everready</span>.</p>

<p>“The first time I received Orders to attend his Honour on a
Cruise,—‘<i>Tom Thrifty</i>,’ (said the gallant Veteran,) ‘be sure,
have Every Thing ready for Action to-Morrow Morning before Eight
o’Clock. <i>Getting out well is half the Battle.</i>’ ‘I will take
care, your Honour, not to be later than Eight.’</p>

<p>“‘Not <i>later</i>, Sir!—Pipe all hands a <i>Quarter Before</i>, if
you please, Sir!!—a Quarter <i>Before</i>, Sir!!!—to that Quarter
of an Hour I owe all my success in Life!!!—Do you think that Old
<span class="smcap">Everready</span> would have won every Battle he has fought, if he had
not always had a Broadside ready to pour into the Enemy, <i>Before</i>
it was expected that any Engagement could possibly take place!—<i>Oh!
that precious Quarter of an Hour!</i>—it has been, as a body may say,
the Guardian Spirit which has gained me all my Laurels. Now, my Boy,
let me heave a bit of advice to You; if you wish to keep clear of the
shoals of <i>Disappointment</i>, take <i>Preparation</i> for your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>Purser, and <i>Punctuality</i> for your Pilot—they will put you into
the track of <i>Preferment</i>; and if you mind that your vessel is
well ballasted with <i>Integrity</i>, you may carry almost what Sail
you will with safety, and soon hope to cast anchor for Life in the Bay
of Independence.’”</p>

<p><i>When you order your Coachman to call for you</i>, tell him to send
you notice of his arrival as soon as he comes, and that within Two
minutes after you hear of it, you will either come or send to him—if
you do not, to conclude that you have not been told, and desire him
peremptorily to order that you may be informed of it, for some people
are Rude enough to desire their Servants not to tell their Guests that
their Carriage is come, until just such time as they wish them gone.</p>

<p>The surest plan of protecting yourself from the tricks of such folks,
and of knowing when your Carriage is come, is to give your Coachman a
<span class="smcap">Letter</span> directed to you, on which is written “<i>An Immediate
Answer is desired</i>.” Direct him to deliver this wherever you are,
with a special request that it may be <i>given to you directly, as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>requires an Immediate Answer</i>: this may also serve the purpose of
furnishing you with an excellent excuse to get away as early as you
please.</p>

<p>Do not order your Carriage till you actually want it; and enter it the
moment it comes to the Door, especially in Cold and Wet Weather.</p>

<p>Have a <i>Good going Clock</i> placed where it may be easily seen by
all the Members of your Household; by which let them set their Watches.
Desire your Coachman, when he comes for Orders, to set his by this
Clock; and then, if he is a steady fellow, by referring to your own,
you will see when he comes for you. Let his Watch be so regulated,
that it may rather gain than lose. If it be not a very good one, if it
is set every morning by a good clock, it will answer almost all the
purposes of a <i>Good</i> one. Keep it <i>five minutes too Fast</i>,
and tell him to keep all appointments by its Dial, as if it shewed the
True time.</p>

<p>Before you start from home, give your Coachman distinct directions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>when to come for you; and do this yourself: if you do it by deputy, or
when you get out of your Carriage, and probably in a hurry, a mistake
is easily enough made. When he is to call for you at any place with
which you are not quite certain that he is acquainted, let the plainest
possible Direction thereto be given him in Writing.</p>

<p>An experienced Driver can always calculate how long he will be in
going; and when you tell him to come for you, you may be certain that
he need never be more than five minutes after the time you order him:
thus, you will be independent of any information from the Servants at
the House where you visit.</p>

<p><i>If you go out to Dinner in London</i>, a distance exceeding Three
Miles, it is more advisable to put up your Horses, than to send them
Home, as the wear of the Carriage in doing the double work of going
home and coming again for you, will cost as much as you will be charged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>for Hay at a Livery Stable, which will not be more than Two Shillings
(including 6<i>d.</i> to the Hostler). Moreover, it is convenient to
have the power of returning home sooner or later, as you like, without
danger of your Servants and Horses catching Cold in waiting for you.</p>

<p>It is customary to allow the Coachman some refreshment when your Horses
are put up, while you are at Dinner. Whatever you choose to give, give
in Money.</p>

<p><i>If you go out to Dinner in the Country</i>, your Nags will like to
Dine too, and have half a peck of Corn and some Hay also. Different
Inns vary in their charges from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (including
6<i>d.</i> to the Hostler) to 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p><i>When you go out to Dinner in the Environs of Town</i>, where you
have not been before, and are unacquainted with the Topography of the
Country, start at least a quarter of an hour earlier than you may think
is absolutely necessary, that you may have time to find the House,
which is not always very easy, especially if your friend has only
lately resided there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p><i>Those who dwell in Suburban Villas</i>, have (or ought to have)
engraved on the back of their Cards, <i>a Map of the Road from the
Stones’ end to their House</i>. This would save their Visitors a vast
deal of trouble, and they would not have their Dinner spoiled quite so
often, by their Guests not arriving in time, from not knowing the way.</p>

<p><i>Persons dwelling four or five Miles from Town, and those who invite
Friends from the Country to dine with them</i>, should Dine, and have
all such Parties at least an Hour or two earlier than the fashionable
town time, so that their Guests may get home at their usual hour of
retiring to Rest.</p>

<p>For people who live half a Dozen Miles from the Standard in Cornhill,
to invite you, or you to invite them, to a <i>Dinner Party</i> later
than Four o’clock, or an <i>Evening Party</i> later than Seven, is
one of the most ridiculous affectations imaginable! Courteous Reader,
summon resolution enough to <i>set a Good</i> Example:—surely this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>cannot require more Courage than it does to <i>follow a Bad</i>
Example.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>As soon as you set up a Carriage, lots of Idle and Impertinent People,
and all the various branches of “the <i>Skin Flint’s</i>,” and “the
<i>Save All’s</i>,” are up early on the alert, setting all kinds of
Traps to ride at your cost.</p>

<p>Caution those Friends to whom you may give such accommodation, not
to mention it: if they trot about, telling every one that they and
you know, that “<i>Mr. Benevolus</i> was so good as to lend us his
Carriage, and we had such a nice ride all round here and there, and &amp;c.”</p>

<p>If any of the numerous members of the “<i>Free and Easy</i>,” or
“the <i>Save All</i>” families, who happen to have the slightest
acquaintance with you, hear that you have given this accommodation
to some very old and excellent Friend, who may have honestly earned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>every attention that you can possibly offer:—I should not wonder,
if they were to Whisper to one another, “Oh, oh! is it so?—well,—I
have really a vast respect for Mr. B.—hav’nt you? And if he is so
exceedingly fond of Lending his Leathern convenience, don’t you think
that we ought to do him the favour to Borrow it?—it will be so
exceedingly convenient when we go to our Uncle <i>Makefeasts</i>—for
we can’t hire a Glass Coach to take us Ten Miles and back under
<i>Thirty</i> Shillings, you know!”</p>

<p><i>If you have any regard for Punctuality</i>, take care who you carry
with you, especially <i>when going out to Dinner</i>!</p>

<p>If you undertake to carry people to one place, some unreasonable
selfish beings are, not seldom, so pleased at an opportunity of shewing
off “<i>en carrosse</i>,” that they will plague you with perpetual
solicitations to stop at almost every Door they pass;—Aye, and act as
if they fancied that they were jumping in “<i>an Errand Cart</i>.” Tell
such Free and Easy folks very plainly, that <i>you must be at a certain
Place at a certain Time</i>, and have not a moment to spare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>If you have any Mercy for your Horses, lend them not to others, unless
you limit the <i>Time</i> they are to be out, and the <i>Distance and
Pace</i> they are to go; say not exceeding ten Miles. Consider, you
may be called upon to go a long Journey to-morrow, and if your Horses
are over-worked to-day, how are you to get on? This caution to your
Coachman is quite necessary, my good Reader; for those who borrow
Horses and Carriages have been found willing enough to work them hard
enough! If those who borrow it ask the Coachman to do any more work
than you have directed him, tell him if he does it, it is at the peril
of losing his place, and desire him to say plainly, “Such are my
Master’s orders; if I disobey them he will discharge me the moment I
return home.”</p>

<p>Forbid your Coachman receiving any present from those he carries.
<i>Give him yourself, before he goes</i>, the same perquisite that
you would give another person’s Servant who had driven you as far
as he is going to drive your Friends, who will be Shabby companions
indeed, if they do not offer him something, and who will tell you if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>he refuses to take it.—If they are not furiously anxious to acquaint
you with your Servant’s <i>Integrity</i>, they, most likely, may have
<i>Self-Love</i> enough to wish to prove to you their own liberal
intentions.—On such occasions, tell your Servants to say gently and
respectfully, “I am much obliged to you, Sir—I am equally obliged to
you, but my Master has already paid me extra for attending upon you.”</p>

<p>“<i>Edmund Burke</i> brought with him and retained the hospitable
customs of his Country. I knew an old School-fellow of his, who
used almost annually to go to London from Ireland, frequently with
some of his Family: they used to lodge at his house. Mr. Burke sent
his Servants and Carriage with them to a considerable distance from
Town, when the Guests, on parting with the Footman, expressed their
obligations for the attention shewn them, and put a piece of Gold into
the Coachman’s hand. ‘I cannot receive this, Sir: it would displease
Mr. Burke exceedingly.’ ‘But I don’t intend ever to let him know any
thing about it.’ ‘Sir, I should use my Master extremely ill were I to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>consent: for he gives me extra Wages, on the express condition of my
not receiving any thing from those who visit him.’ ‘Thou art right,
and I will report thy Integrity to thy Master.’”—<i>Dr. Walker’s
Fragments</i>, 8vo. p. 118. 1802.</p>

<p>“Many are the tricks of Coachmen,” says the sagacious <span class="allsmcap">DEAN
SWIFT</span>.</p>

<p>“If they are not in the humour to Drive, they will tell their Master
that the Horses have caught Cold—are off their Feed—want Shoeing—the
Harness is out of order—Wet Weather roughens their Coats: and if any
body takes a liking to one of your Nags, and they can get a Guinea by
selling it, will persuade you to part with it, by telling you that he
is beginning to be touched in his Wind, or Foundered, or is so Vicious
that it has become dangerous to drive him.”</p>

<p>1. He <i>will not</i> gratify a greedy Innkeeper, Hackneyman, Hay
Farmer, Coachmaker, Sadler, or other Tradesman, at the expense of his
Employer; but, in laying out his Master’s Money, will be as careful as
if it was his own.</p>

<p>2. <i>He will not</i> leave his Master to the care of the Waiter and
his Horses to the Hostler, and think only of Himself; but take care
and attend to both, and be particularly careful that his Horses are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>well dressed, well fed<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>, and well littered, and that their Shoes,
Saddles, &amp;c. are in proper condition to continue their Journey.</p>

<p>3. <i>He will not</i>, in disagreeable weather, urge the Hostler to say
the Roads are bad, in order to detain him till the weather is better,
or to go round a particular way.</p>

<p>4. <i>He will not</i> recommend Strong Beer to his Horses, or Brandy to
their Heels, in order to gratify a thirsty palate, at the expense of
his own Head, and his Master’s Pocket.</p>

<p>5. <i>He will not</i> contrive to have a Horse’s Shoe loose, or drive
in a Stone to make him halt, in order to shorten or delay a day’s
Journey; or advise his Master to stop under pretence of the Horses
being faint and weak.</p>

<p>6. <i>He will not</i> recommend particular Inns out of favour to the
Landlord or the Hostler, or with a view of getting an extraordinary
Dram for such recommendation.</p>

<p>7. <i>He will not</i>, if he is employed to purchase Hay or Straw, &amp;c.,
trot up and down the Market till he has found <i>the Cheapest</i>, and
then charge it to his Master as <i>the Dearest</i>.</p>

<p>8. <i>He will not</i>, when leading his Master’s Horse from one part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>of the country to another, suffer it to be hard ridden, either to
oblige an old acquaintance, or to put half-a-crown into his own Pocket.</p>

<p>9. <i>He will not</i>, when sent alone to any distance, go round or out
of his way to see an old friend, and then, to fetch up the time, gallop
his Horse till he can scarce stand upon his Legs.</p>

<p>10. <i>He will not</i>, when Airing his Horses, play tricks with them,
gallop them against other Horses for a Pint and a Pipe, or leap them
over places that may stake them or spoil them.</p>

<p>11. <i>He will not</i>, to save his attendance in the Stable, fill the
rack to the top with Hay, and the Manger to the brim with Oats, so as
to occasion either being wasted; nor, to save his trouble, let the
dirty litter stand under a Horse the whole day.</p>

<p>12. <i>He will not</i>, when he is to carry his Master’s Great Coat in
a strap behind him, wrap his own Coat up in it, or leave his Master’s
Coat outwards to get Wet, in case it should Rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>13. <i>He will not</i>, when he comes to an Inn, after a hard day’s
Journey, in cold and dirty weather, leave his Horses to a Stable Boy,
to splash them up to their bellies, in Water, in order to wash them;
suffer them to drink their fill, and then gallop them full speed a
mile to warm them, whilst he is indulging himself with Purl and Hot
Pot by the Kitchen Fire, although “Some Grooms are quite as curious in
providing good Cheer for Themselves as they are for their Horses,” says
the <i>Sieur Sollysell</i>, in his <i>Compleat Horseman</i>, fol. p.
110. 1717.</p>

<p>14. <i>He will not</i>, if his Horse drops a Shoe, gallop him as hard
as he can to the next Smith, to the danger of his feet, but will travel
on gently.</p>

<p>15. <i>He will not</i>, if he wants to spend an hour at an Ale-house,
go out with an old Girth or Stirrup Leather in his hands, under
pretence of getting it mended.</p>

<p class="p2">Coachmen have generally some spare hours, and would do wisely to
learn a business at which they could work during such leisure;—such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>provident diligence would, in a few years, enable them to ride Inside
instead of Outside of a Coach:—perhaps the most useful Trade they

<p><i>To ensure Punctuality in your Visits</i>, which, Civility says,
ought to be returned with as much Celerity as Convenience will
permit, give your Coachman a List of the Places he is to take you
to, and the Time you are to be there: the various branches of the
<i>Gad-abouts</i>, who delight in the laborious Idleness of paying
Morning Visits, and wish to pay as many as possible, in as little time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>as possible, and spend their time in being Driven to Doors, where they
anxiously desire—not to be admitted, will find the above hint very
valuable.</p>

<p><i>When you go about paying Visits</i>, (especially in Cold Weather),
desire your Coachman not to drive faster than Five miles an

<p class="center">
MAP OF LONDON<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">and the Environs is as needful an Article in a Carriage, as a Compass

<p>The size of this said Town of London is strangely changed since <i>Mr.
Sorbiere</i> wrote his <i>Journey to London</i>, 8vo. 1698, in p. 5 of
which he says, “But that which makes the dwelling in the City of London
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>most delightfully diverting, is the <i>extremely pleasant facility of
walking out into the Fields</i>!!!”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, instead of the Fields being come-atable with extremely pleasant
facility! before you can put your Foot upon a blade of <i>Verdant</i>
Grass, (there is <i>Black</i> Grass enough in the Squares), you must
drag your Legs through a Grove of Houses of at least two or three Miles
in length!</p>

<p><i>The New Road from Paddington to Islington</i> was, till lately, the
Boundary line for limiting the ruinous rage for Building on the North
side of the Town.—There is a <i>Ground Plan of the New Road</i>, from
Islington to the Edgeware Road, shewing the then state of the Ground,
(and the names of the Proprietors thereof) between Oxford Street and
the New Road, in the Supplement to the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for
1755.</p>

<p>A Stop ought to be put to the practice of constructing irregular groups
of Houses. “The <span class="smcap">Act of Parliament</span> for forming the New <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>Road,
which was made in 1755, directs that no building be erected within
Fifty feet<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> of the <i>New Road</i>.”</p>

<p>“The present <i>mean appearance of the backs of the Houses and Hovels
have rendered this approach to the Capital a scene of confusion and
deformity</i>, extremely unbecoming the character of a Great and
Opulent City.”—<i>Gwynn’s London Improved</i>, 4to. p. 11.</p>

<p>Mr. Gwynn’s remarks apply very aptly to <i>that Quarter of a Mile of
the New Road which is between Westgate Turnpike at the crossing of
Gower Street North, and the East Entrance to the Regent’s Park</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern</i> and <i>Western</i> avenues to <span class="smcap">The Regent’s
Park</span> are as they ought to be: the Roads are wide, and the space
between the Houses and the Road is laid out in Gardens, as <span class="smcap">the
Act</span> directs—very different is the approach from the City along
the <i>Eastern</i> Road from the point above mentioned, which is
narrow, and is perpetually obstructed by the Waggons, &amp;c. that are
unloading at the Timber and Stone Yards, &amp;c.; occupying the ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>which the Act of Parliament has ordered shall be <i>used only for
Gardens</i>. The intention of this judicious clause was, no doubt,
to preserve the Light, Air, and Cheerfulness, so highly necessary to
a great leading Thoroughfare—such it has hitherto been, and with
increasing respectability, excepting at the one point I am about to
mention—many great Improvements have taken place—such as <i>the
Regent’s Park and Crescent</i>—<i>The New Pancras Church and Euston
Square</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. With these useful and even splendid works upon
the same line of Road, it becomes a matter of Surprise, that the
distance <i>between Westgate turnpike, at the crossing of Gower Street
North, up to the Regent’s Park</i>, should not only remain without
any reformation, but that buildings,—workmen’s huts,—sheds,—smoky
chimneys, and all manner of nuisances, should be allowed not only to
continue, but to increase daily close to the Road.</p>

<p>In proceeding from the City Westward, a fine line of road, and noble
footpaths <i>on each side</i>, are found, until on arriving near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>Tottenham Court Road both appear to terminate abruptly, and the
Road is faced, and its regularity destroyed by the projection of a
range of low buildings and hovels, converted, or now converting, into
small Houses, close to the Highway, which, strange to say, is much
<i>narrowed</i>, at a point where, from the increased traffic caused by
the crossing of the Road to Hampstead, a considerable increase of width
is doubly requisite.</p>

<p>But here the Houses project about Ten feet, and nearly close up the
footpath; and this being one of the stations for the Paddington Coaches
to stop at, it becomes a service of no small danger to drive through
the very small opening that is left for the public to pass through.</p>

<p>A few yards further, on both sides of the Road, are ranges of Stone
Yards, with the incessant music of Sawing, Chipping, and Hacking stone,
grinding Chisels, and sharpening of Saws. Cow yards, picturesque stacks
of Timber, building materials, and dead walls.</p>

<p>Another angle turned, and the Traveller emerges again from the region
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>of smoke, stone dust, and mud, and traversing some hazardous passages,
pounces at once into the magnificent Crescent of the <span class="smcap">Regent’s
Park</span>, wondering at the utter lack of Public Taste, which could
allow such a combination of Nuisances to exist, and even increase, in
the immediate neighbourhood of this great Public Improvement, and along
the only Road leading to it from the City of London.</p>

<p>Can the blame attach to the Commissioners of Mary-le-bone Roads
Trust?—or is it caused by the contending Interests of the 21 Paving
Boards of the Parish of St. Pancras, <i>that the footpath on the South
side of that quarter of a mile of Road is neither Paved nor Watched</i>.</p>

<p>Without venturing to propose <i>a Circus, or large open space, at
the crossing of the New Road and Tottenham Court Road</i>, with an
<span class="smcap">Obelisk</span> in the centre, like that in St. George’s Fields, where
there is not half the traffic there is at this point—at which, for
want of space, Accidents happen almost daily; and which accommodation
to the Public, in this age of Improvement, is not to be considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>impossible—it may not be impertinent to suggest, that the few houses
which project into the Road on both sides, as well as the Sheds,
which are, by continual additions, gradually converting into Houses,
should be immediately removed; some of them are at this present time
undergoing additions,—the longer this measure is delayed, the more
expensive will the purchase become;—at present, Money might be easily
raised for amply remunerating the occupiers of the premises alluded to,
and a great public Benefit produced without any injury to Individuals.</p>

<p>If the Clause in the Act of Parliament, alluded to above, had been kept
in due force, the Evils would not have arisen.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the <span class="smcap">New Commissioners of the Roads</span>, who
have the power, will have also the inclination, to remedy these Evils
without delay, and that <span class="smcap">the Parish</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Commissioners
who have the management of the Regent’s Park</span> will unite their
endeavours for the same purpose.</p>

<p>In other quarters of the Town, our Economical Ancestors appear to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>considered him as the most ingenious Architect, who could build up
the greatest number of Houses in a given Space—the Palladios of the
present day, are as prodigal of Space, as their frugal Forefathers were
parsimonious, and seem to fancy, that he is the cleverest fellow who
pulls most Houses down in a given time.</p>

<p>It must be granted, that the Town is improved by the Widening of the
Streets; but while it is the Fashion, for the Idle Children of the
Largest Growth, to all run together, into one Street, at One Hour;
it avails little how wide it may be; nor can it counteract the sad
inconvenience which arises from the extending of the Buildings, making
it impossible for two-thirds of the Inhabitants of London ever to enjoy
the animating influence of a walk in the fresh and fragrant Air of the
Country—a blessing which was within their reach, when they had only
to cross the New Road to be in the <i>Mary-le-bone Fields</i>;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>on which, read the following remarks, which we copied from “<i>the
Examiner</i>” of Sunday, the 22d of October, 1826:—</p>

<p>“To call the enclosure of these Fields <span class="smcap">a Park</span>, is, with all
submission, a little bit of a <i>Misnomer</i>; at least, it is no
Park at present for the Public, who are excluded from all but <i>the
gravelled Roads</i>, which are ornamented with about <span class="smcap">Fifteen
Benches</span> (without backs), <i>in a circle of Three Miles in
circumference!</i> the nearest of which to the New Road, on the West
side, is more than a Mile from it!! Surely the Managers of this concern
might afford to give us as comfortable Seats, and as plenty of them,
as those which have been lately so liberally and so properly placed in
‘<i>Hyde Park</i>.’</p>

<p>“Many Valetudinarians, and Persons advanced in Life, who stand most in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>need of the invigorating influence of pure Air, cannot Walk more than
a Mile without Resting—such persons are tired by the time they get to
the Park; but if there were <i>Benches placed along the Walks opposite
Park Square</i>, <i>York Terrace</i>, &amp;c., the weak and the weary might
rest themselves, and then toddle on and treat their Lungs with a little
fresh Air.”</p>

<p>It is said, that the Reason given for excluding the People from the
Park, is, that the Trees are so young that they <i>might</i> be easily
torn up—so <i>may</i> those on the North side of <i>Hyde Park</i>,
for they are no older: but softly, is not this presuming that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bull</span> is a greater Brute, than the Beasts which are grazing
where he ought to be walking?</p>

<p>The Persons who keep this ground from the Public, charity commands
us to hope, do so, for reasons which appear to them to be good and
sufficient; perhaps they think that it is most profitably, if not most
properly, employed in being let out, as it appears to be, to Gardeners
and Graziers!—at the same time gradually cutting it up into sites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>for Buildings as fast as they can find persons to speculate in it. To
effect this without incurring the notice and consequent indignation
of the Public, the encroachments upon their expected Playground have
generally been commenced in the Winter Season, at a time when there are
few People to observe them; and are so far advanced before the arrival
of Fine weather, that it is useless to complain—The Ground is gone,
for 99 years!!!</p>

<p>“Our gracious <span class="smcap">King</span> gave this ground to the Public,—surely a
part of it at least might be open to that Public. Is it not a pity to
see it wholly occupied by Market Gardeners, and Horses, and Cows, and
Calves, to the total exclusion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Bull</span> himself!”</p>

<p>“<i>When</i> and <i>What Part</i> of the Park is to be opened?”</p>

<p>The Public should certainly be informed of this, as it would guide them
in the choice of Residences: some will like to live opposite to the
lively scene which will be in the Part which is thrown open,—others,
the quiet of that part that is opposite to the Slip of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>ground which is
appropriated to the occupiers of the houses in the Park, and Persons
who pay for Keys.</p>

<p>A certain portion, opposite to Portland Place, from which there is no
View and no Variety, has been recently decorated with Rows of Trees.
Surely this is not all that is to be saved from the Villa builders.</p>

<p>Who would propose to build Villas upon the highest and best ground in
<i>Hyde Park</i>? and why should a difference be made?</p>

<p>Are these Parks not equally the property of the Public? And the site
of <i>the Regent’s Park</i>, if left unoccupied by buildings, would be
<i>more generally</i> valuable to the Public as an Airing Ground, as it
is more centrically situated than the other.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>To know how to Drive, so as to preserve the Carriage from the injury
which it would otherwise receive by violent Jolts, Twists, &amp;c., is a
Merit of no small Value.</p>

<p>If a Carriage is driven on uneven ground, it requires great Attention,
or it will receive more injury during a journey of a Mile, than it
would by a Month’s moderate use on an even Road; therefore,</p>

<p><i>The Pace</i> in Driving should be accommodated to the roughness of
the Road.</p>

<p><i>The Turnings</i> should be regulated by the Room. If a Carriage is
not wheeled fairly across a channel, the Perch is twisted according to
the descent, as the one Wheel falls, in proportion as the other at the
opposite angle rises; and frequently by such a wrench the main or Perch
Bolt is broken, and every part strained, especially when going <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>fast.
Desire your Coachman to <i>avoid all short sharp Turnings</i>; it is
much wiser to go on a few poles further, where another Street will
allow plenty of room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hard-Driving</span>, <i>especially on the Stones</i>, exposes a
Carriage to many mischiefs, either by running against other Vehicles,
or breaking by the violence of its own motion.</p>

<p>Some fidgety Coachmen are continually whipping, or, as it is
technically termed, “<i>fanning</i>” their Horses—this frets the
poor creatures, and puts them into a state of irritation extremely
injurious to them, and your Carriage moves in a “hop, skip, and
jump” style:—Forbid all use of the Whip, but in cases of inevitable
necessity.</p>

<p>Tell your Coachman that your motto for Drivers is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“<i>Slow</i> and <i>Sure</i>;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that the First time he presumes to attempt to display his Dexterity in
any place by what is termed <i>driving to an Inch</i>, shall be the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>last time that you will trouble him to wear your Livery.—<i>Five
Miles in an Hour</i> is quite fast enough for Crowded Streets;
especially when turning Corners, and in Streets which have many other
Streets leading into them, as Oxford Street, Cheapside, &amp;c.—Better
wait Five minutes quietly, or follow a Hackney Coach for Ten paces,
than cut and dash along at the risk of your Wheels, your Pannels, and
your Neck, &amp;c.: however, you must give him a license to drive a little
“<i>ad libitum</i>” in some situations; a rapid movement is sometimes
really requisite, in order to escape out of the way of Carts and
Waggons, &amp;c.</p>

<p>An experienced Whip, who has a sharp sight, may calculate pretty
nearly what space will be sufficient to pass between two bodies
which are at rest—but as he will unavoidably meet many Carriages,
guided by inexperienced, and often drunken Drivers, which do not for
half a minute together move in a precisely direct line, and his good
Coachmanship cannot protect him against such Blunderers, unless he
proceeds with extreme care, and allows them plenty of room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>A cautious Coachman is ever unremittingly upon the look out, keeping
both his Eyes open; employing One to guide his own Horses, and the
Other to watch how those who are coming guide theirs; or, as a Wag
might say, <i>an Accomplis’d Coachman ought to Squint!</i> He depends
entirely upon his own Attention to keep so completely out of their way,
that it may be next to impossible for them to run against him.</p>

<p>The most Crowded places are not always the most Dangerous: Accidents
most frequently happen from <i>empty One Horse Carts</i>, in which
the Driver rides, instead of walking by the side of the Horse. These
vehicles are frequently conducted at such a furious rate by Carmen, in
order to make up for the time they have wasted, in tippling, that they
often run against inexperienced Coachmen. They abound most in Tottenham
Court Road and Holborn, and the outlets from Town.</p>

<p>Every <i>Cart</i> that approaches, a wary Coachman watches with the
most anxious care, and gives all the room it appears to require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>A Fine of at least 10<i>s.</i> should be levied upon all persons
driving Carts in such a manner, payable to any person who may demand
it. In the event of their occasioning an Accident, let them not only be
fined but punished severely.</p>

<p>If your Coachman drives leisurely, you will escape many Dangers, and
your Carriage last much longer;—by such gentle use (excepting as
to the Wheels) it is worn almost as little as if it remained in the
Coach-house.</p>

<p><i>In Crowded Streets</i>, never permit any person to ride on the
Coach Box:—Conversation diverts the attention of the Driver from his
Business, and accidents frequently ensue.</p>

<p>Never go into the City through the Strand, Fleet Street, and Cheapside,
if you can avoid it, after twelve o’clock: from that hour until five
o’clock, they are crowded with Carriages and Carts. In these great
Thoroughfares <i>Hackney Coach Stands</i> should not be permitted. At
present the centre of Cheapside, &amp;c. is sometimes filled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>with a Stand
of <i>Hackney Coaches</i> all the way from St. Paul’s to the Poultry:
let these be removed from all Crowded Streets into the Cross Streets
adjoining, as is ordered in <i>Bond Street</i>.</p>

<p><i>If the Hackney Coach Stands are removed from the Strand</i>,
<i>Fleet Street</i>, &amp;c., the Public will no longer have to complain of
the tedious Stoppages which are now so frequent between two and four
o’clock of the Day, especially on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays.</p>

<p>If you go into the City on Mondays and Fridays you will have to
encounter <i>the most</i> <span class="smcap">Barbarous Nuisance</span> <i>that disgraces
the British Capital</i>—droves of Oxen passing through its principal
Streets in the middle of the Day. That this is still suffered to
continue in these times of universal improvement appears to us as
wonderful as it is offensive.</p>

<p><i>To know to a Nicety at what Time you must start</i> to arrive at
a certain Place at a certain Hour, you have nothing to do but to
ascertain <i>the Distance</i>, and direct <i>the Pace</i> of travelling.</p>

<p><i>When you wish to go Faster or Slower</i>, do not say simply
“<i>Faster</i>,” or “<i>Slower</i>,” but say “<i>Four</i>,”
“<i>Six</i>,” or “<i>Eight</i>,” according to the number of Miles you
wish to be driven in an Hour.</p>

<p>In traversing the main Streets of London, always allow at least five
minutes in every half hour for Stoppages.</p>

<p><i>Desire your Coachman to choose the Pleasantest, rather than the
Nearest way.</i> Some inconsiderate charioteers, to save the tenth part
of a Mile, will drive you through all the nasty narrow Lanes they can
find, as if they were trying to make you sick with foul air. Moreover,
such Bye-ways are generally so badly Paved, that you will be longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>going over them than on a good road that is a little longer.</p>

<p><i>Persons who have not an expert Coachman</i>, who has been accustomed
to cut his way through Crowded Streets, should desire their Driver to
avoid the great Thoroughfares, and to pass along the widest Streets
which run parallel to them. This can generally be done without danger
by a very young Coachman.</p>


<p class="center p2">WHEN YOU STOP IN A PUBLIC STREET,</p>

<p class="noindent">caution your Coachman always to avoid stopping where there is any other
Carriage stopping near, either on the same, or on the other side of
the way; and when he can, to choose the widest part of the Street,
and <i>to draw up his Fore Wheels close to the Curb, and his Hinder
Wheels quite square with them</i>. Most of the Accidents which happen
to Carriages, while stopping in Crowded Streets, are owing to want of
attention to this situation of the Hinder Wheels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Whenever you get out of your Carriage, <i>Always Shut the Door</i>. If
you only stop Two Minutes, it may be necessary for the Coachman to move
from his station to prevent injury from other Carriages; and if the
Door is open it will swing about, and the Hinges will be strained, and
the Pannels may also get a violent blow against a Post, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Never keep your Carriage standing in a great Thoroughfare</i>,
through which crowds of Coaches, Carts, &amp;c. are passing; in so doing,
you are a source of great inconvenience to others, by occasioning
stoppages; and your own Pannels are every moment in danger of being
defaced, &amp;c., which cannot be repaired without fresh Painting the whole
of the Body: this tedious process will deprive you of the use of your
Carriage for at least Three Weeks; therefore, let it wait for you round
the corner of some quiet neighbouring Street.</p>

<p>Remember the judicious Advice given by that arch adept in “<i>the Art
of Shopping</i>,” <i>Lady Betty Buybargain</i>, to her Niece, <i>Miss
K. Cutadash</i>. The fair Kitty was ever and anon irritably anxious to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>be whirled to the Door of every “<i>Magazin des Modes</i>” that her
caprice called her to, in her Aunt’s shewy Carriage; saying, “I assure
you, that if you go in your Carriage, my Dear Aunt, the people are
infinitely politer than they are to their Walking Customers.” “Aye!
Aye!” replied the discreet Dowager, “what you say may be True enough,
Dear, and their Politeness would be pleasant enough, Love, <i>If</i>,
as my poor dear <i>Sir Benjamin Buybargain</i> always used to say,
<i>If</i> they did’nt Book it, Kitty!—but they charge for it, my
Child; they charge for it, Dear!—as <i>Sir Benjamin</i> used to say,
‘they put those Bows down in Their Bills!!!’”</p>

<p>However, there is nothing in which more People are more extremely
mistaken, than in the general idea that keeping a Carriage always
is (as it ought to be) infallible evidence of superfluous Wealth.
Many pompous persons, in order to provide the means of indulging in
this expensive Luxury, are miserably penurious in all other matters;
and many Fine Liveries, &amp;c. have been purchased with the Money that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>ought to have been spent in Food, Fire, &amp;c.; and to cut a dash at
Vanity Fair, and keep up an external glitter, the Comfort of Home is
entirely sacrificed:—as <i>Sir Spendthrift</i> says, “They must have a
Carriage, if they are obliged to save it a Thousand ways.”</p>


<p class="center p2">NEVER BREAK THE RANKS,</p>

<p class="noindent">either in Crowded Streets or when setting down at Public Places: by
attempting thus impatiently (and unfairly) to save a few minutes, many
Carriages have been destroyed, and many Lives have been lost.</p>

<p><i>In admitting others into the Rank</i>, (which you have often an
opportunity of doing,) “<i>Do as you would be Done by</i>.”</p>


<p class="center p2">THE WISEST PLAN WHEN GOING TO THEATRES,</p>

<p class="noindent">or other extremely Crowded places, is, when the weather permits, to be
put down a little before you get to them. This, however, is hardly ever
necessary when going, when it is both more safe and more desirable, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>many reasons, to be set down at the Door.</p>

<p><i>When your Carriage is brought to take you Home</i>, desire your
Coachman to select, for this purpose, a situation where there is least
danger of being blockaded in by other Carriages, rather than that which
may be nearest and most convenient to get in,—it is to little purpose
that you can get Into your Carriage, if that cannot get Out.</p>

<p>Observe this particularly at the Play, or other Public places. If
the weather is at all favourable, you can get to your Carriage in a
tenth part of the time, and at half the risk, it can get to you; and
even delicate Ladies will suffer less by skipping a few yards along
the Pavement, than by waiting half an hour or more in the dangerous
draughts of a cold Lobby or perishing Ante-room.</p>

<p>As soon as the Play or the Party is over, most people are in desperate
haste to get Home; however, as <i>Tom Thrifty</i> says, “Nothing is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>done well that is done in a Hurry, except catching of Fleas.” The
frightful Confusion created in the immediate vicinity of crowded
Assemblies, will be carefully avoided by all persons who wish to
preserve their Carriage from damage, and their Persons from risk:
even at a large party, in a private house, to get up to the Door is
sometimes a service of both difficulty and danger.</p>

<p><i>When you pull the Check String</i>, and do not at the same time
direct the Coachman to stop at any particular House, tell him to take
care not to stop before <i>the Door</i> of any House, but <i>in the
middle</i> between Houses, so as not to give any persons the needless
trouble to come to their Door, from an idea that you are coming to
their House. And desire him never to drive up to a Door in the furious
manner which vulgar Coachmen seem to imagine is very stylish, but to go
at his usual quiet pace.</p>

<p>During what is termed <i>an Airing</i>, get as much pure Air as you
can without risk of taking Cold: rather put down the Front than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>Side Windows; the former are convenient for giving directions to the
Coachman: by merely uttering the word “<i>Left</i>” or “<i>Right</i>,”
you may direct his track wherever you wish.</p>

<p>In Cold weather, you may do this, by telling him to look round just
before he comes to a Turning, by putting your hand to the Right hand
front Glass when he is to go to the <i>Right</i>, and to the Left hand
when he is to go to the <i>Left</i>: or you may arrange, that one smart
pull of the Check String means “to turn to the <i>Right</i>;” a double
one, “to the <i>Left</i>;” and a continued one, “to stop where he is.”</p>

<p>When you call out <span class="smcap">Stop!</span> without saying or pointing to
<i>where</i>, tell him you mean that he should instantly <i>Stop, i.
e.</i> as quickly, and as nearly as possible where he then is, even if
that be in the middle of a muddy Street.</p>

<p>One of the many and great advantages of having a Coachman a long time
in your service, is, that a single word will direct him where to drive
you: you have merely to say the name of the Street, or the Person to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>which you wish him to carry you. One Word does it; therefore, if you
love your Lungs, beware of changing your Coachman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Fielding</span>, the famous Police Magistrate, who was
blind, had a pipe fixed from the Carriage to the Coach Box, through
which he could converse with the Coachman, without being heard by
others. When his Chariot was stopped by any obstruction in the Streets,
he inquired of the Coachman what kind of Carriage, &amp;c. occasioned it;
and it was his humour then to put out his head, and shout out in his
usual peremptory tone, “Take that Cart out of the way!” or, “You Sir,
in that Chaise, drive on!” This occasioned great astonishment, how he,
who was blind, could perceive the cause of the stoppage, and was a
source of great amusement to Sir John.</p>

<p>Desire your Coachman never to dispute with, or return any Uncivil
language to any Coachman, Carman, &amp;c.: if your Carriage is obstructed
or offended by any disorderly persons, take out your Pocket Book, and
let them see you are setting down their Number, and then coolly tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>them you will summon them if they do not immediately clear the way.</p>

<p>By the 1st Geo. I. c. 57, “Drivers of Hackney Coaches are to give way
to Gentlemen’s Carriages, under a penalty of 10s.”</p>

<p><i>If your Carriage be injured</i> by another running against it,
ascertain whose Carriage has done the mischief, and let your Coachmaker
give an Estimate of what he will charge for repairing it; then, before
you have the repair done, let the person who injured it see the
mischief and pay the sum charged for amending it. <i>Mr. Jarvis</i>
says, that the custom is for the Repair to be done by the Coachmaker of
the Party who committed the Injury.</p>

<p>If curious Children ask “Whose Carriage is this?” tell your Coachman to
Stare full in their face, and Say Nothing: if they have the Impudence
to repeat the Question, he may reply, “it belongs to Mr. <span class="smcap">Pry</span>.”
If equivocation be ever allowable, it is to such Impertinents.</p>

<p>Those who may admire the Carriage and want to know who built it, will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>find the Coachmaker’s name on the Axle-tree Caps.</p>

<p>If any of your Coachman’s own acquaintance speak to him while he is
either driving or waiting for You, he must answer them only by a civil
movement of his Head or Whip hand. Nothing is more disrespectful and
disorderly than Gossiping while on Duty.</p>

</div>
<hr class="r5">

<p>Have an exact <i>Inventory</i> of the Harness, Working Utensils, and
every thing appertaining to your Carriage; give a Copy of this to your
Coachman, and once in Three months examine the state of the various
articles.</p>

<p>A Carriage (especially when newly Painted) should be cleaned as soon as
possible after it has been used.</p>

<p>A conscientious Coachman, who has any regard either for your Carriage
or his own Character, will never permit any body to touch it but
himself. If in your Visits to the Stable, you frequently find him
out, or observe any persons lurking about there, who are meddling
with either your Horses or your Carriage, be sure that he is Idle and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>worthless, or has Business of his Own, which he likes better than
Yours:—then let him follow it.</p>

<p>The sooner you give such a Gentleman notice to quit, the better.</p>

<p>Never permit a Coachman to keep either Fowls, Pigeons, Dogs, Goats,
Pigs, &amp;c. which will not only eat your Corn, but be a public Nuisance
to your Neighbours; for which offence you will be Indicted. See page 87.</p>

<p>If a Carriage cannot be cleaned till the dirt is dry, let it be well
sluiced, and let the water have time to loosen it:—by rubbing it when
dry, the sand and gravel in the Dirt will inevitably scratch off the
Varnish and deface the Paint. When the Pannels have been heated by the
Sun, they should not be washed till they become cool.</p>

<p>While the Pannels are wet they must not be exposed to the Sun, which
ought to be avoided at all times as much as possible, as nothing
injures the Varnish more.</p>

<p>The Iron work must be wiped quite dry, particularly the Springs: if the
wet gets between the Plates they will rust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>A Regular Coachman will get his Carriage and Horses cleaned and
dressed as early in the morning as he can, and not wait lounging about
to know when he will be wanted.</p>

<p>An active Stable-Man will begin his work by Six in the Morning: to set
his Stable to rights, and Dress a pair of Horses, will take from an
Hour and a Half to Two Hours.</p>

<p>Washing and Cleaning the Carriage and Harness will take from Two to
Three Hours, according to the work on the Harness, &amp;c.: including his
time for Breakfast, &amp;c., he will be ready by Eleven.</p>

<p>However late he comes home, a good Groom will oil and wipe the Bits,
wash his Horses’ feet, give them a whisp down, &amp;c.—to shake their Beds
down, and give them Water and Corn, and to rack them up for the Night;
if he has a Carriage, he will also dish-clout the Body of it, will take
about from an Hour, to an Hour and a Half: therefore, when a Coachman
is required to wait at Table, let him be Home a full Hour and a Half
before he is so wanted.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p class="center p2">THE HAMMERCLOTH.</p>

<p>When Coaches were first introduced, our frugal ancestors used to load
the Carriage with provisions for the family when they came to London.
The <i>hamper</i>, covered with a <i>cloth</i>, was a convenient
repository, and a seat for the Coachman. This was afterwards converted
into a <i>Box</i>. <i>Hammercloth</i> is therefore very probably a
corruption of <i>Hamper-cloth</i>: it is now one of the principal
Ornaments to a Carriage:—according to the fulness of the plaiting of
the Cloth, its depth, and the quantity of Trimming thereon, is the cost
thereof, which varies from £10. to £40.</p>

<p>After a dusty Journey, let it be well brushed: if it is not, and it
gets wetted, it will be spoiled; the Lace and Fringe cuddle dust
greedily, and ought to be diligently disturbed.</p>


<p class="center p2">SCREWING THE BOLTS.</p>

<p>The shaking of the Carriage frequently loosens the Bolts and Nuts<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>and if these are not attended to immediately, the Timber, Iron work,
&amp;c. will suffer material injury.—A Coachman may attend to this as well
as a Coachmaker.</p>

<p>A Careful Coachman will gently try the Nuts about once a fortnight;
but, in screwing them up, use no violence, and take care not to injure
the Paint with the Wrench.</p>


<p class="center p2">RATTLING</p>

<p class="noindent">is very disagreeable, and is a sign of something being loose about the
Carriage, which requires to be tightened or lined with Leather; where
Iron works upon Iron, if a thin piece of Leather can be introduced
between, the Rattling will be stopped.</p>

<p><i>The Squeaking</i> of any part is to be cured by a little Oil or
Grease: this frequently happens in the Bolts of the Springs, or in the
shackles where the wet has got in and rusted them; it often proceeds
from some loose Nut or Bolt.</p>

<p><i>A Carriage, when first Painted</i>, requires great care to prevent
it from being spotted with Dirt—the Colour and Varnish take a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>considerable time to harden before they can entirely resist the action
of Wet, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If Dirt be allowed to dry and remain on the Carriage, some Colours
(especially a bright Green) will be marked with Spots, which are not
removed without considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>Therefore, the moment a Newly-painted Carriage returns from Work,
sluice the Pannels well, and with a wet Sponge wipe them clean all
over. If dusty with Road dust, take it off as gently as possible with a
Soft Brush—wiping it with a Cloth will scratch it.</p>

<p>Stains will also appear where the Rain has run for any length of time;
to remove which, rub the pannels with a little sweet Oil on a bit of
soft baize, so as just to damp them; rub the stained places with a
little more strength than the other parts of the pannels; dry them off
with another piece of baize, then with a third piece, and a little
flour; wipe or rub the pannels very dry; and if the stain has not then
disappeared, rub it hard with the palm of a dry soft hand, drawing it
smartly down, till the friction elicits a sharp squeaking sound. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>will probably clear the Stains; if not, after a short interval repeat
the same process: if then it cannot be cleared, the Colour or Paint
beneath the Varnish is injured, and nothing but time will effect a
change.</p>

<p>Rubbing common Varnished Bodies rather strong with a soft Skin,
and drying them with another, helps to increase the lustre of the
Varnish—a common Varnished body, well kept and often cleaned,
frequently improves in its lustre.</p>


<p class="center p2">HIGHLY VARNISHED PANNELS.</p>

<p>The clear brightness of this polished surface shews every little
blemish; and though likely to be stained from the same causes as the
other, yet the colour is not so apt to be affected, as it is much more
thickly coated with Varnish, and the resistance stronger—to clear
them, use the means before mentioned.</p>


<p class="center p2">TO RESTORE THE LUSTRE OF VARNISH.</p>

<p>The Varnish looking dull, striking in, or cracking, as often arises
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>from the badness of its own quality, as from any improper treatment in
the Cleaning, or effect of the Weather: the high Varnish in particular,
on account of the extra quantity, which, if not good, produces a change
much sooner that the common Varnish, the latter being much thinner.</p>

<p>When Varnish Cracks, it can only be remedied by the Painter, who
should be immediately applied to; but if Varnish strikes in, and looks
dull, as is sometimes the case in very damp weather, use the following
means:—Get a quarter of a pound of Rotten Stone or Tripoly Powder
from a Colour Shop, which must be ground with water, and used of the
consistency of paste, in the following manner:—Double a piece of
woollen cloth, and with the flat part rub each pannel with a gentle
force for about a quarter of an hour, taking care to rub it equally
all over; wash off the substance, and with a hand free from corns,
and damped with a soft leather, rub it smartly downwards, till by the
friction it makes a shrieking noise: if this does not sufficiently
polish, the rubbing with the Rotten Stone and the hand should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>repeated. Much depends upon the hand rubbing clean off the pannels
and mouldings as before directed with soft baize, oil, and flour. If
well managed, the Body will look nearly as well as if new Painted,
particularly a common Varnished Body, especially if it has never gone
through the process before.</p>

<p>Thus, with one or two days’ trouble, and at the expense of about one
Shilling, New Painting may sometimes be saved.</p>

<p>Let <i>the Carpet</i> at the Bottom of the Carriage be often cleaned
and reversed, so that the wear may not always be in one place; for
Winter use and for dirty Weather, one of the <i>Dressed Sheep’s
Skins</i> is the best foot warmer for the floor of a Carriage.</p>


<p class="center p2">DOORS.</p>

<p>These, in New Carriages, will shrink in Dry, and swell in Damp Weather,
however well seasoned the Wood may be—their tightness may often be
cured by rubbing the edges with a little Soap:—be cautious not to
touch either Door or Door Post with the Knife while damp weather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>continues; for sometimes they will shrink in Dry as much as they
swell in Damp weather; and when Summer returns, you will find you have
irremediably injured your Doors.</p>


<p class="center p2">HINGES.</p>

<p>If these move stiffly, a few drops of Sweet Oil will generally make
them easy enough.</p>


<p class="center p2">GLASSES AND SHUTTERS.</p>

<p>If these do not slide easy enough, rub the grooves in which they slide
with a little Soap—long exposure to wet will sometimes make them move
stiffly; but after a few fine dry days, they will return to their
proper dimensions.</p>


<p class="center p2">STEPS.</p>

<p>If the Joints are stiff, drop a little Sweet Oil upon them, and work
them well up and down.</p>


<p class="center p2">SPARE PAINT.</p>

<p>Lastly; a little of the same Colour as that with which the Carriage is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>painted, should be kept in reserve to repair Accidents:—Colours can
seldom be exactly matched; you will find that it is very convenient for
touching the Mouldings occasionally;—as much of each Colour as will
fill a pint pot will be sufficient; keep it in a pan under water.</p>

<p>The Brushes must be kept under Water;—but with all possible skill and
care. New and Old Colours seldom match nearly enough for repairing any
accident or bruise happening to a Pannel, which had generally as well
be left as it is until you repaint the Carriage.</p>

<p>Let your Coachman have some “<i>Black Japan</i>,” to retouch those
parts of the Carriage which are blacked, but which are frequently
defaced by use: this will contribute greatly to the neat appearance of
it.</p>

</div>
<hr class="r5">

<p>The Expense of Keeping a Carriage in Repair is regulated very much by
the original quality thereof—by the Work it has done—the Work it
does, and the Care taken of it.</p>

<p>The Work it does may, in some measure, be computed by the wear of its
Wheels, and its Appearance.</p>

<p>It is in a Carriage as in many other mechanical structures, that, in
order to Repair it, it must be taken to pieces; and the taking to
pieces and putting together again, costs more than the Repair itself,
and thus the charges for trifling things appear enormous. The expense
of unhanging, taking to pieces, putting together, and re-hanging, is
the same in small as in large Repairs: some Coachmakers copiously
mention in their bills every circumstance of the Job, almost to
the number of turns of the screws, or blows of the hammer, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>constant repetition of driving out—driving in—taking off—putting
on—unscrewing—screwing—nailing—unnailing—unhanging and re-hanging,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., which sometimes seems to be done only to confound the
charge for the Job with so many different matters as to make it
perfectly incomprehensible.</p>

<p>To the above we have actually seen added, when the Carriage was taken
to the Coachmaker’s to have any little Job done, “<i>To Washing and
Cleaning</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>”—although the Coachman assured us
that the Carriage was clean when he took it, and that he found it dirty
when he went to fetch it home.</p>

<p>We refer the Reader to the</p>

<p class="center">CAUTIONS ON REPAIRING CARRIAGES,</p>

<p class="noindent">which are given in <a href="#Page_60">page 60</a> of this Work.</p>

<p>A Carriage cannot be taken to pieces and put together, by the most
careful and skilful Workman, without in some degree diminishing
both the Beauty and Strength of the Machinery; therefore, when it
is asunder, order that every part that appears defective be made
good, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>that the repetition of such separation may occur as seldom as
possible, not only to avoid Expense, but the Inconvenience of being
without your Carriage while the Repairs are going on, which take longer
time than people expect, who do not consider that New Timbers, Iron
work, &amp;c. require Painting and Varnishing, which must have at some
seasons of the Year a considerable time to dry thoroughly hard.</p>

<p>When any of the main Timbers begin to decay, the greater part may be
supposed to be in a similar state; failures then become frequent, and
it is prudent to have the whole that is decayed renewed at once—which
will not only be Safest, but will save much Expense and Trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> <i>Be extremely cautious of altering</i> any part of a
Carriage—if you alter one part, it often becomes necessary to alter
many other parts, and a trifling Expense becomes a very heavy one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span> The Carriages commonly lent by common Coachmakers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>while they are repairing a Carriage, are sometimes so extremely old
and ricketty, that it is not only disagreeable, but dangerous to
ride in them;—insist upon having a good effective Vehicle, or go to
another Coachmaker; therefore, <i>before you send a Carriage to be
repaired</i>, desire the Coachmaker to let you see the Carriage which
he intends to lend you during the time your own is repairing: this
accommodation he ought to give you, if you are a constant customer,
without making any charge for the use thereof.</p>

<p><i>Have an Estimate in Writing</i>, particularly specifying every thing
that is to be done, and the whole Expense for which he will undertake
to make perfect every Repair that is wanting, without any subsequent
extra charge, and the Time in which he will do so. I again repeat, that
it is the cheapest and best plan To <span class="smcap">Job</span> a Carriage as well as
Horses. See <i>Estimates</i>, No. 4 and No. 9.</p>

<p>Desire your Coachman to be continually on the Watch, and to immediately
acquaint you of the least injury which the Carriage may sustain; for
the immediate repair thereof, is equally advisable, both <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>for your
Economy, and for his own Safety.</p>

<p>The chief parts that wear, are the Timber works of the Carriage part,
and these fail more frequently than you may expect—either from decay,
faulty wood, or being too light made, and sometimes from Accident or
Violence, which may be judged of when they are taken asunder.</p>

<p>The <i>Body</i> requires Repair much less frequently than the
<i>Carriage</i>, because it is placed on Springs in as easy a manner as
possible, and therefore not shook about so violently as the Carriage
part; but the <i>best plan is to have Springs under the Carriage fixed
on the Axle-tree</i>: Carriages so mounted last three times as long
as those on the old construction, and are extremely desirable from so
seldom requiring separation.</p>


<p class="center p2">UNDER SPRINGS</p>

<p class="noindent">Are strongly recommended. They afford the following advantages:—there
is no occasion for the Coachman’s seat to be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>attached to the Body, nor
extra Springs for the same, which are a nuisance from their Noise and
continually requiring Repairs:—the Coachman’s seat, to an Underspring
Carriage, is bolted on a Budget, and fixed to the Carriage on a pair of
Carved Blocks, the Body hanging free:—the additional expense is from
£20. to £30.; but we have been told they save full an hundred and fifty
pounds in the wear of a Carriage;—but remember, that although <i>Under
Springs</i> are easy to the Carriage, they are not so to the Carried,
especially those whose top half is a <i>Dummy</i>, <i>i. e.</i> made
of wood, which is used for cheapness. My last Chariot, which has such
Springs, jerks and jumps about as much as a rough Trotting Horse,
affording fine <i>Anti-bilious</i> Exercise for those in tolerable
Health, but is intolerably agitating to an Invalid!!</p>

<p>To define a perfect Horse is almost, and to find one, quite
impossible.—<i>Camerarius</i> says, that this useful and beautiful
creature is an assemblage of Excellencies—“He should possess Two
of the Beauties of a Woman; the Breast must be plump, and the
Hips round.—In three things he should resemble <i>a Lion</i>; in
ferocity of countenance, in fortitude, and irresistible impetuosity.
He must have three things appertaining to a <i>Sheep</i>;—the
nose, gentleness, and patience;—three of a <i>Mule</i>, strength,
perseverance, and sureness of foot;—three of a <i>Deer</i>, head,
legs, and skin;—three of a <i>Wolf</i>, throat, neck, and ears;—two
of a <i>Fox</i>, tail and trot;—three of a <i>Serpent</i>, memory,
sight, and flexibility;—and lastly, three of a <i>Hare</i>, running,
walking, and perseverance.</p>

<p>“Round hoofed, short jointed, Fetlock shag and long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

Horse of Adonis.</i></p>

<p>No man who has witnessed the performance of <i>Mr. Ducrow’s</i> stud in
“<i>the Battle of Waterloo</i>” at Astley’s, will deny, that our Poet
Pope’s epithet of “half-reasoning” is not quite as justly due to the
sagacity of the Horse, as it is to the Elephant.</p>

<p>It would be Injustice not to add, that the energetic and natural acting
of <i>Mr. Gomersal</i> in his personation of “<i>Buonaparte</i>,” is as
perfect a performance as the English stage can exhibit.</p>

<p>The whole of this Drama is a very extraordinary effort, and does great
credit to the ingenious author of it, <i>Mr. J. Amherst</i>.</p>

<p>The figure and symmetry of the Horse is no where more perfectly
displayed, than in <i>the Equestrian Statue of Charles the First</i>,
at Charing Cross, which is said to be the most finished piece of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>workmanship of its kind ever produced: that of Marcus Aurelius, or the
two Horses on the Monte Cavallo, or Quirino at Rome, not excepted.</p>

<p>Continually, however, in our sight, this “<i>Chef d’Œuvre</i>” is
not only disregarded, but neglected.</p>

<p>English Horses, are equally remarkable for their Strength and for their
Speed.</p>

<p><i>Pack Horses</i> in Yorkshire carry, not unusually, loads of 420
Pounds.</p>

<p>A <i>London Dray Horse</i> has been known to move, on a plane surface
for a short space, the weight of Three Tons, and to draw half that
weight a considerable distance.</p>

<p>On the Turnpike road, one Ton per horse is <i>the Weight usually
allowed for a Journey</i>.</p>

<p>The famous <i>Childers</i> moved 82½ Feet in one second of time, which
is nearly at the rate of a Mile in a Minute; for he ran round a course
at Newmarket (little less than four miles) in six minutes and forty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>seconds; a degree of Velocity, which no horse has been known to exceed.</p>

<p>Another account avers that he ran over another course at Newmarket
(which is 380 yards more than Four English Miles) in 7½ Minutes.</p>

<p>In general, the Racers run round the Four Mile course in about seven
minutes and forty seconds, or eight minutes, which gives Forty-four
feet six inches in one second of time, and twenty-four English feet at
each stretch.</p>

<p>The late Duke of Queensberry, on the 29th of August, 1750, won his
wager, that he would produce a machine, with four wheels, which should
pass over 19 miles in six minutes. The Carriage was made by Wright, of
Long Acre, and was constructed partly of Wood and partly of Whalebone;
and for the Harness, Silk was substituted for Leather.</p>

<p>The match was run at Newmarket, and four blood Horses rushing on with
a velocity almost rivalling the progress of sound, darted within the
appointed time to the Goal.—See an Engraving and particular Account of
this Carriage in the <i>Gents. Mag.</i> for 1756, p. 440.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>It would be happy if a Law were passed to prevent the furious spirit
of Gaming which prevails at <i>Horse Races</i>:—this amusement might
also be rendered useful, which it is not at present, for Horses of most
Speed, are generally of least Use.</p>

<p>If <i>Premiums</i> were allotted to those who brought to the field the
strongest and most beautiful Horses of the best paces for the Saddle,
Coach, or Cart, the Breed of these useful Animals might be really
improved.</p>

<p>As managed at present, <i>Horse Racing</i> is but one remove from the
barbarous practice of “<i>Bear-baiting</i>,” and “<i>Bull-baiting</i>,”
against which that excellent practical philosopher, <i>Montaigne</i>,
has protested his honest Indignation, that “Few people are pleased to
see Beasts caress, or play together; but many seem delighted to see
them lacerate and worry one another.”</p>

PURCHASERS OF HORSES.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">
<p>To decide by the first appearance of a Horse, as to what he may prove
on continual Exercise, is a perfection of Judgment which not even
Experience itself can confer. Those erudite Equestrians, <i>Will
Whipcord</i> and <i>Sam Spur</i>, candidly assured us, that</p>

<p class="center">HORSES WHICH ARE FOR SALE</p>

<p class="noindent">are usually so pampered and highly fed, and have the interstices of
their Muscles so filled with Fat, that their real shape, <span class="smcap">i. e.</span>
their form when in full Exercise, and with their ordinary Food, cannot
be imagined.</p>

<p>If Dealers meet with a Horse that is unable to stand to the work they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>require of him, they let his Business be so light, that it may be
merely Play to him—and so keep him in Condition till they can dispose
of him.</p>

<p>Appearances are so deceitful, that the above-named skilful Jockeys
confessed to me that they frequently found themselves mistaken. In the
selection of a Horse, we rarely seek for latent good qualities, when
the Eye is disgusted by deformity. A Horse of true proportions strikes
the fancy of every beholder; we immediately assent to the beauty of the
object, and take it for granted that Symmetry must be accompanied with
either Strength or Swiftness. True Judgment is displayed in selecting
a Horse possessing great powers, under the cover of an ill-favoured
outward appearance, and discriminating from among those of a pleasing
form such as are devoid of them.</p>

<p>Many who have written on Horses have attributed much to <i>the
influence of Colour on the Constitutions of Horses</i>; but we fancy
that Colour is often suffered to bias the decision on a Horse’s
Goodness, when it should be considered merely as it relates to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>Beauty. Many will not buy a Horse which has a <i>White Leg</i>; but
<i>White Legs</i> are as likely to fly as <i>Black Legs</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Mennill, of Leicestershire’s, famous hunter,
“<i>Whitestockings</i>,” had four White Legs; and a better hunter never
leaped a Gate. <i>Childers</i> had White Legs.</p>

<p>A Horse of symmetry and good action should not be undervalued from any
peculiarity of Colour. Good Judges of Horses are very indifferent to
the irregularity of Marks, &amp;c. Thus much, however, is certain, that
some colours denote Strength and Hardiness more than others, and are
also more Beautiful; as the Dappled Grey,—Bays, particularly the
Dappled, Golden, and Blood Bays, with the Legs, muzzle, tails, and list
down the back black, Nutmeg Greys, Dark Duns, with mane, muzzle, tail,
and legs, Black.</p>

<p>A mealy Bay and light Chesnut, or what is commonly called Sorrel, are
for the most part delicate in Constitution. The latter is also often of
a hot and choleric disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>As the Proverb says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">“<i>A Good Horse cannot be of a Bad Colour.</i>”</div>

<p>Few things are more difficult to find than Horses that are exactly what
you wish.</p>

<p>“It is a cruel thing to say, but a very true one, that amongst the
present breed of Horses in this nation, a man of any tolerable judgment
can hardly find One in Fifty for his purpose, whether designed to Draw
or Ride.”—<i>Wm. Osmer on Horses</i>, 8vo. p. 59.</p>

<p>Many of the Defects of Horses cannot be discovered till they have
been in your possession some days. As that experienced Equestrian,
<i>Mr. Geoffrey Gambado</i>, said, some Horsedealers, like some other
Merchants, are “not a bit honester than they ought to be.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Hanway</i> observes, that “If the <i>Gentleman</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> seldom
treats his <i>Friend</i>, (and hardly ever an indifferent person,) with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>strict honour in selling a Horse!—what are we to expect of those who
have been bred among Horses?”—<i>Hanway’s Travels</i>, 8vo. 1757, vol.
i. p. 206.</p>

<p>The only safe, and indeed the only satisfactory plan, both to the
Seller and to the Buyer of a Horse, is to</p>

    <div class="verse indent12">“Try,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Before you Buy,”</div>

<p class="noindent">as <i>Capt. Bindon</i> cautions you, “Don’t fall in Love with him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>before you Ride him.” In his <i>Gentleman’s Pocket Farrier</i>,
printed at Edinburgh in 1731, of which most of the works with a similar
title are incorrect copies, with merely another name to them.</p>

<p>Deal with a respectable Man, to whom you have been well recommended,
and stipulate, that if after a Trial for a day or two, you do not like
your purchase, that upon paying a certain Sum you may return it. This
sort of Agreement will not always be acceded to, unless you are known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>to the Dealer, and are a constant Customer.</p>

<p><i>If you have a Pair of Horses on trial</i>, the usual charge for
them, you finding provender, is about Two Guineas per Week:—Try them
by driving them two or three times seven or eight Miles into the
Country, where there is a good Hill to go up, such as Highgate or
Hampstead Hill, you will soon find out what kind of Temper they are
of:—if they have any lameness, or defects, &amp;c.—and if they <i>work
equally, and step well together</i>, which is extremely important;—if
they are not of equal Courage and equal Pace, your Coachman will be
obliged to be continually whipping one of them, in order to keep him
to his Collar; and he cannot flog the Idle horse without hurting the
feelings of his Industrious companion, and also those of the Persons he
is driving, who, if they have any humanity, will not bear to see the
willing suffer for the sluggishness of the Lazy. Moreover, every time
the Whip is used the Horses spring forward, and the Carriage goes in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>Hop, Step, and a Jump kind of style, which is extremely disagreeable.</p>

<p><i>Sluggish Horses are good for Nought</i>, but to drag a Cart. Your
own Arms will be almost as soon tired in making them move their Legs,
as if you had travelled as far on your own Feet.</p>

<p>The following paragraphs are from “The New Method of Managing Horses,
by the Thrice Noble, High and Puissant <span class="smcap">William Cavendishe</span>,
Duke, Marquess, and Earl of Newcastle,” fol. 1667:—</p>

<p>“Be not afraid of a Horse who shews <i>Strength</i>, <i>Spirit</i>,
and <i>Stomach</i>: a Horse having them cannot choose but be made a
<i>Ready Horse</i>, if he be under the Discipline of an Understanding
Hand and Knowing Heels.</p>

<p>“When a Horse doth not <i>Rebel</i> it shews Weakness and faintness of
<i>Spirit</i>, and no Courage. Where Nature is much Wanting, it is hard
for Art to supply it.”—P. 199.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Trying</span> is the only way to <span class="smcap">know Horses</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“I told you that Marks, Colours, and Elements, are nothing at all to
know a Horse by; they are but <i>Philosophical Mountebanks</i> that
talk of such <i>Toyes</i>. Nay, <i>Shape</i> is nothing to know the
Goodness of a Horse—<i>the best Philosophy is to Try him</i>; and you
may be deceived then, if he be a Young Horse;—Colts alter extremely
both in <i>Spirits</i> and <i>Strength</i>. What Judgment can one give
of a <i>Little Boy</i>, what <i>Kind of Man</i> he will prove? No more
can one give a Judgment of a Colt, what Kind of Horse he will prove.
<i>Ride</i> him and <i>Try</i> him; that is the best <i>Philosophy</i>
to know him by.”—P. 104.</p>

<p>“A Young Horse of <i>Three Years Old</i> is but a <i>Gristle</i>,”
saith his Grace of Newcastle, in p. 202 of his Book.</p>

<p>“For any Man that would have <i>a Horse of Use</i> in his ordinary
occasions, or for <i>Journeys</i>, or <i>Hunting</i>, I would never buy
a Horse till the <i>Mark be out of his Mouth</i>, <i>i. e.</i> till he
be <span class="smcap">Seven</span> years old; and if he be sound Wind, Limb, and Sight,
he will then last you Eight or Nine Years.</p>

<p>“A Young Horse will have as many <i>Diseases</i> as a Young Child,
and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>you will have to leave him with your Host at some Inn, and hire
another Horse for your Occasion; and have your Host’s Bill, and the
Farrier’s, which will come to more than your Horse is Worth; and
there’s your <i>Young</i> Horse; but your hearty <i>Old</i> Horse shall
never Fail you.”</p>

<p>There is more Trouble in looking after <i>One</i> Young Horse than in
taking care of <i>Two</i> old ones.</p>

<p>Let the Horse you select for trial be stripped—let your own Servant
(who being a stranger to him will not know how to humour defects or
conceal any dispositions he may have to vice, &amp;c.) walk and trot
him in a strait line, on a paved piece of Road, such as is used for
this purpose at the Veterinary College at Saint Pancras; while you
stand alternately before and behind him; observe well if he has any
inequality in his motions—see if he steps firmly on the ground—stop
him often—put him on again—observe whether in setting off he has a
partiality for either Leg, beyond that which seems to be natural to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>Horses in every part of the World, of taking off with the Left.</p>

<p><i>If a Horse is Lame with one Leg</i>, it is sometimes disguised by
putting in a Stone between the Shoe and the sole of the other foot,
which is so judiciously contrived as to make him pick them both up
alike.</p>

<p><i>The best way to discover Lameness</i> is to have the horse rode so
as to be heated; let him then be put into the stable till he get cool,
when take him out for another trot, and examine again.</p>

<p>They sometimes bring Horses for trial, heated, by which many bad
qualities and defects are concealed; dull Horses are animated, while
the vicious pass as mere mettlesome; with many other disadvantages
to the Purchasers, endless to mention. The best way is to get to the
Dealer’s <i>early</i> in the Morning, before you are expected, and you
will so find out more defects than any other way.</p>

<p>If the Horse be heated, let him be turned into the Stable till he
gets cool; go up to him by yourself—examine him—observe his general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>manners, and, above all, to judge of his Temper watch his Eye:—a
Horse never plays a vicious trick, or thinks of one, without shewing
his intention to do so by his Eye;—study the Eye of a Horse during the
usual operations of the Stable, and you will be enabled to form some
opinion of his Temper and Disposition.</p>

<p>The following account was given to me by a friend who has had great
experience in Horses:</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt that a vicious Horse is to be known by his
Eye:—I took a Horse to Mr. Professor Colman, at the Veterinary
College, St. Pancras, to be examined previous to purchasing;—he had on
a water-deck, the Day being Wet; the wind caused it to flap against his
sides, and he reared and plunged most violently. Mr. <span class="smcap">Colman</span>,
whose Judgment respecting Horses I had previously repeatedly consulted
with the greatest advantage, after looking at him for a few minutes,
decidedly pronounced him to be a Vicious Horse. I begged Mr. C. to
tell me whether he judged so from his plunging occasioned by what is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>mentioned: he said No, from his Eye; he was constantly trying to look
back:—however, I bought the Horse; and sure enough the Professor’s
prognostic was perfectly true—he was decidedly vicious! the very next
day he attempted a grand go at kicking and plunging, and did great
damage to my Carriage.”</p>

<p>For the following Advice, we are indebted to as Honest a Man as any
that deals in Horse-Flesh.</p>

<p>“I have found many persons who have purchased Horses of me, very
inquisitive and troublesome about their Eyes; indeed, as much so as if
their Eyes were any way concerned in the action of the Animal. As I
know they are not, I give myself very little trouble about them:—if a
Rider is in full possession of his own, what his Horse has is perfectly
immaterial.</p>

<p>“Be sure to buy a <i>Broken-knee’d Horse</i>, whenever he falls in your
way: the best bit of flesh that ever was crossed will certainly come
down one day or another; whereas, one that has fallen, (and sacrificed
himself pretty much,) never will fall again, if he can help it.</p>

<p>“Buy any thing but a <i>Threatener</i>. By the Threatener, Man himself,
the Lord of the Creation, who subdues all the Animals that range the
Forest, is himself kept in fear and trepidation!—This ingenious Animal
has the sagacity, at every step, to threaten the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>fracture of his
Rider’s neck, probably with a view to abolish the practice of Riding;
but has, at the same time, the good sense not to fall quite down, lest
he should accidentally break his own. As amongst Pigeons, so amongst
Horses, there are <i>Tumblers</i>: the feat is, however, performed
differently, and varies a little in its effects on the performers: the
Pigeon executes it without any thing on its back; the Horse seldom
achieves it without somebody upon his. To the latter, therefore, we
must give the greatest share of merit, who ventures to perform upon a
hard Road what the other does only in the Air, without even a cloud to
brush against. The one seeming to prefer the Milky, and the other the
Highway.”—See the Duke of Newcastle on <i>Horses</i>; Lord Pembroke
on <i>Breaking Horses</i>, &amp;c. 12mo. 1761; Mr. Berenger’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span><i>Art of

HEALTH OF HORSES.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">

<p>The methods of treating and keeping Horses are as various, and, for the
generality, as inconsistent with reason as those of Shoeing are; but a
little consideration would, in most common cases, direct people right
in both. One pampers his Cattle, with a view of strengthening them; and
afterwards, by way of correction, pours down Drugs into them without
thought or measure:—Another lets no Air at all into his Stable; and
his Horses inevitably catch cold when they stir out of it, and get
Fevers if they stay in it, by corrupted Air:—a Third, equally wise,
leaves his Stable open, and his Cattle exposed to the wind and weather
at all times, whether his horses or the weather be hot or cold, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>and
frequently even in wind drafts, while they are in a sweat.</p>

<p>All these practices are alike attended with destruction to Horses; as
also are the many extravagances that prevail in the same contradictory
extremes, with regard to Coverings. But in answer to all these foolish
systems, reason plainly suggests to us, that proper wholesome Food, a
well tempered circulation of sweet Air, moderate and constant Exercise,
with due care and suitable clothing, as weather and occasions may
require, will never fail to preserve Horses sound and in health.</p>

<p>No Vulgar Error is more common, than that Horses cannot continue well,
unless they are periodically Bled, Purged, and crammed with <i>Cordial
Balls</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>After a very Hard day’s Work</i>, give him a couple of Gallons of
<i>Gruel</i>, made by putting a Quart of Oatmeal into a pail, stir it
together with a little cold water, then add the proper quantity of
boiling water, half a Gallon of good Strong Ale, and two Wine-glasses
of Brandy: this the old Fox-hunter will tell you is better than all the
<i>Cordial Balls</i> that were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>ever composed. In cases of Emergency,
when a Horse is distressed, a Quart of Mulled Beer; or, in an extreme
Case, a Bottle of Wine, will refresh him like a charm.</p>

<p>The following is Squire <i>Tallyho’s</i> advice respecting Physic:—</p>

<p>The Day after a hard Run, on inquiring how his Horses were, his Groom
replied, “They are pretty well; but I think, Sir, that a little Physic
would do them good.”—“Why,” said the Squire, “would you give them
Physic? Do they Eat well, and Drink Well, and Sleep well?”—“Yes,
Sir.”—“Well then, what good do you expect to do by giving them Physic?
You don’t take Physic yourself when you are Well, do you, Tom?”—“No,
Sir.”—“Then why give it to a Horse?”</p>

<p>To prevent Diseases and preserve the Health of Horses, there is seldom
occasion for Bleeding, Purging, or any other Physicking, &amp;c., if a
proper attention be paid to procure them,</p>

<p>1st. Sufficiently spacious and well-aired Stables: at the bottom of
each Stall there should be, rather beyond the centre, a Grating, so
that the Stable may always be dry; the Litter will last longer, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>Stable be sweet and wholesome.</p>

<p>“In Russia, and other Northern Countries, Horses lie on boards
without inconvenience, from which it would appear a great saving
might be made if our own stalls were provided with frames for Horses
to lie on without a litter. They may be constructed in the following
manner:—Suppose the stall to be 6 feet wide and 9 feet long, then
eight deal boards eight inches wide, nailed one inch apart to three
or more ledges about two or three inches deep should be prepared for
each stall. The Horse will lie dry, what falls must be swept off, and
the frame turned up by day. Thus all the litter will be saved, and the
straw, reed, or fern, be given for food. The frame will, probably,
not cost more than the straw used for litter in a season. The boards
will be very little injured, and may afterwards be applied to common
purposes.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 1.5em;">(<i>From the Dublin Courier.</i>)</span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p><i>Cleanliness in a Stable</i> is extremely important: let the Mangers
be well washed once a Week, and wipe down the Stalls, and whitewash it
once a year.</p>

<p>Let the Horse Cloths be scoured at the same time—it preserves the
Cloths, and prevents the Moths getting into them.</p>

<p>When it is considered that Saddle or Coach-horses, on an average, pass
at least 20 out of every 24 hours, or full five-sixths of their time
in the Stable: the importance of keeping that as clean as possible, is
evident enough without further Argument. <i>The Stalls</i> should not
be less than six feet in the clear width.</p>

<p>2d. Allow them plenty of wholesome Food and Drink, in proportion to
the Work required of them, due Exercise when they are not at Work, and
good Rubbing and Dressing twice or thrice every day—“It is regular
Feeding and Dressing which maketh Horses fat and Healthy, not the mere
great abundance and rest alone which maketh plump. A man need not much
trouble himself to inquire after Physic for this purpose: upon my word,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>there is no other Secret to perform this, but to observe a methodical
manner of Feeding and Dressing.”—<i>Sollysell’s Compleat Horseman</i>,
fol. page 138. 1717.</p>

<p>The last thing at Night, give to those <i>Horses that are very
Lean</i>, about a couple of Quarts of Wetted Bran, over and above their
ordinary allowance of Oats, &amp;c.—a double handful of <i>Cinquefoil</i>,
cut into Chaff, is given by an experienced Stable-man, who was
consulted in forming this work.</p>

<p><i>In Exercising Horses</i>, the farther they are carried from home the
better; <i>i. e.</i> take them four or five miles out and back, and
never go twice one road if you can avoid it: a Horse will perform his
work more cheerfully, and it breaks his temper to go different roads.</p>

<p>Have them out by Six in the Morning, and give them two hours’ Exercise;
walk them till you get to a nice bit of even ground, and then give them
a good trot or a Canter for a quarter of an hour, but never gallop them
hard.</p>

<p>Never gallop Horses that you are training for Hunting—their Master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>can always take enough out of their Legs when they are in the Field.</p>

<p>Never let a Horse be hard ridden when he has just had his belly-full of
meat or water; but let him move in his own way: he will mend his pace
by degrees.</p>

<p>There are three Intentions answered by Dressing Horses; it cleans them
from dust and dirt; it counteracts the artificial state of inactivity
they are occasionally under by their confinement, by exciting the
Circulation; and lastly, it gives a sleekness to their Coat. Grooms
usually consider only the latter intention; and as Dressing requires
some labour, they idly resort to such means as produce a smooth coat
without Exertion; and this, Experience tells them, is best effected by
Hot Stables: Idleness is the origin of this deviation from Nature; but
to make their masters allow these Hot-House Stables, Grooms tell them
that they improve the Health of the Horse.</p>

<p>“There are but these Four things; viz. <i>Feeding Well</i>, <i>Clothing
Warmly</i>, <i>Many Sweats, and Dressing Well</i>.</p>

<p>“For <i>Dressing</i>, there are these <i>Things</i>: the <i>Curry
Comb</i>, which fetches out Dust; the <i>Dusting Cloth</i>, that takes
away the <i>Loose Dust</i>; the <i>Hard Wisp</i>, a little moistened,
that takes out <i>More Dust</i> yet from him; and the Felt, a little
moistened, that takes out <i>More Dust</i> from him afterwards; but
the <i>Wett Hand</i>, which should be last, takes not only <i>More
Dust</i>, but a great deal of Loose Hair, which is much better than any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>of the Former:—after this, a <i>Linen Cloth</i> to wipe them over,
and then a Woollen Cloth, and so cloathe him up.</p>

<p>“But the Best of all is the <i>Knife of Heat</i>, which is the Scraper;
for when he is Hot, Scraping of him gets all the <i>Sweat</i> and
<i>Moysture</i> out of him, so that he is <i>Dry</i> presently after,
and all that <i>Wett</i> would turn to <i>Dust</i>, so there is so much
Labour saved. Besides, it gets abundance of Hair from him, which the
rest doth not; so that it is the most Excellent thing I know, both to
Cool a Horse, and to give him a <i>Good Coat</i>.”</p>

FOOD OF HORSES.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">

<p>Horses <i>must be Fed in proportion to their Work</i>—they must not be
kept to certain regular Feeds, unless they are kept to certain regular
Work, or Disease will soon overtake them, and Death end them full
Gallop.</p>

<p><i>Our English Cavalry</i>, the labour of which is about equal to
that of a Coach Horse in a Private Carriage, are allowed 14 lb. of
<i>Hay</i>, and 10 lb. of <i>Oats</i> per Day. Government contracts for
Oats to weigh 40 lb. to the Bushel, so that it is a Peck per Day.</p>

<p>To the French Cavalry in Garrison, they distribute the Allowance, and
fix the hours of Feeding in the following manner:</p>

<p><i>At Five</i> o’Clock in the Morning, a third part of Hay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p><i>At Eight</i> o’Clock, a half allowance of Oats, and afterwards a
third of Straw.</p>

<p><i>At Mid-day</i>, a third of Hay.</p>

<p><i>At Three</i> o’Clock, a half allowance of Oats, and afterwards a
third of Straw.</p>

<p><i>At Seven</i> o’Clock in the Evening, a third of Hay, and a third of
Straw.</p>

<p>“<i>Horses are Watered</i> half an hour before receiving the Oats;
consequently, twice a day during the hot weather, and their Thirst
quenched again in the Evening.”—From p. 132 and 133 of <i>Mr. R. de
Rochefort’s Promenades à Cheval</i>. Paris, 16mo. 1826.</p>

<p><i>Blundevill</i>, in his Order of Dieting Horses, 4to. 1609, p. 10,
says, “that half a Peck of Oates, or as much as a Man can easily take
up at six times with both his hands together, is enough to give a Horse
at once.”</p>

<p><i>For Carriage Horses</i> employed in the usual Town work, sixteen to
twenty pounds of sound meadow <i>Hay</i>, with from three quarters to
a Peck of good full <i>Oats</i>, per Day, will be sufficient:—should
Frost, or other circumstances, lessen their labour, their Food should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>be lessened also, and a small proportion of <i>Bran</i> substituted;
on the other hand, when their Exercise is severe, the allowance of
<i>Corn</i> should be increased; to which, when they are worked very
hard, a few <i>Beans</i> are an invigorating addition; a great quantity
of <i>Hay</i> is not good, except for Cart Horses, who are meant for
no other use but to roll on slowly, with a fat fellow full of Beer
swaggering beside them.</p>

<p><i>Lord Pembroke’s</i> plan of feeding Horses, especially Old ones,
with bruised Corn, and Chaff, is to be recommended—“Every grain then
goes to nourishment, and Three feeds go further, than Four, as commonly
given.”</p>

<p>Although a horse has but a short Stomach, he has Long Bowels:—<i>Dr.
Bracken</i> tells us, that “the length of the Alimentary Canal of a
Horse is seldom less than 35 Yards: He must, therefore, feed a little
at a time; and as we know that when our own Stomach is empty, we
feel languid, so does the Horse—and as a small Stomach must be soon
emptied, it requires to be frequently replenished.”</p>

<p>A Horse should have Four feeds in a Day, the first about Six in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>the Morning, the next at Eleven, again at Four, and the last thing
at Night:—of these, Supper and Breakfast should be the Best; the
intermediate Eating should be at about Noon, and four or five hours
after: in the intervening time, let his Rack and Manger be empty, then
when he comes to his meal he will eat with an appetite whatever you
give him.</p>

<p>Make it a Rule, to give your Horses their Food two hours before you
put them to Work—that the first act of the restorative process of
Digestion may be finished before they are disturbed.</p>

<p><i>Young Horses</i>, that have not done growing, have strong Appetites,
and require to be more fully fed than those that have come to Maturity,
but not so much Corn;—Bran, and Clover Hay. Chaff damped, will
occasionally do for them better—Young Horses, like Young Children,
require their Food in Quantity rather than Quality, and the lighter it
is the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soft Water</span> is to be preferred; the condition of a Horse’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>Coat depends much on the quality of the Water that he drinks—very
cold and hard water will break his Coat directly.</p>

<p>A Cavalry Officer informed me, that, observing One Troop in his
Regiment in much finer condition than the rest, he found, on inquiry,
that it was occasioned by the Horses of that Troop drinking <i>Soft</i>
water, while the others had <i>Hard</i> water.</p>


<p class="center p2">HAY</p>

<p class="noindent">Varies quite as much in Quality, as it does in Price—<i>Clover</i>
grass is, by some, considered to be the best; whence the Proverb,
“<i>to Live in Clover</i>.”</p>

<p>The Nose is your best guide in the choice of Hay. <i>Good hard Hay</i>
has a quick and agreeable smell:—it is of great importance that Hay be
good; if it is not, let a Horse eat as much as he will of it, he will
be low and poor.</p>

<p>I am told that there is a great deception practised in Hay Markets:
they take care that those Trusses in the Cart which are likely to be
examined are good; but the main bulk of the Load is not always of
equally good quality.</p>

<p>The Reader is recommended to deal regularly with the same Farmer,
as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>the best security against the deceptions which it is said are
sometimes practised in Markets.</p>

<p>When a Buyer endeavours to bate a Seller down below the regular market
price, it may tempt a Seller to make himself amends, by putting up some
Trusses of inferior Quality, if not of short Weight also.—Say to your
Hay-salesman, “Now mind, I buy this as a load of Good Hay, and I shall
not pay for it till I have unloaded it and found it all right.”</p>

<p>The fresher <i>Hay</i> is cut from the Stack the better: it soon turns
soft and musty in a damp Hayloft, and in the course of a few weeks
loses all its best Qualities.</p>

<p>Never lay Trusses of Hay upon each other: the best way to keep Hay from
Damp and Moulding, is to set it up on its edge—so that a current of
Air may circulate round it.</p>

<p>Go to Market in good time;—if you wait till your Stock is quite out,
you must buy what you can.</p>


<p class="center p2">BEANS</p>

<p class="noindent">are only needful when Horses have a great deal of hard work, and in Wet
weather.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p class="center p2">BRIEFLY, AS TO HORSE-MEAT.</p>

<p>Hay is <i>Horse-Bread</i>.</p>

<p>Corn—<i>Horse-Mutton</i>.</p>

<p>Beans—<i>Horse-Beef</i>:</p>

<p>And the most strengthening substance that can be given them.</p>

<p><i>Good Bran</i> is a useful article in a Horse’s diet, and when
Scalded, with a handful of Salt to it, is occasionally as good a Mash
for a Horse as a Mess of Gruel is for a Man.</p>

<p>A Truss of <i>Hay</i> should weigh 56 lbs.</p>

<p>A Truss of <i>Straw</i>, 36 lbs.</p>

SENDING HORSES TO GRASS.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">

<p>Delicate Horses who have been treated over tenderly, and have long
stood warmly clothed in a hot Stable, must not be all at once turned
out to Grass in cold Weather.</p>

<p>A Horse must have “the Constitution of a Horse” indeed, who can stand
such a shock; for which, he should be gradually prepared by diminishing
his Clothing, and gradually accustoming him to the Open Air;</p>

<p>Let him be well fed till the day that he is turned out, on which give
him nothing; then he will graze the greatest part of the Night;—<i>if
you turn him out with a full Belly, he will lay down, and most likely
catch a mischievous Cold.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>When Horses are sent to Straw-Yard or to Grass, let their Shoes be
removed, and their Feet set at liberty—Toe-pieces are sometimes put on.</p>

<p><i>Early Spring Grass</i>, for five weeks in May and June, is not only
excellent Food, but admirable Physic for Horses;—<i>Dr. Green</i>
cures most of the Disorders that Horses are subject to, sooner than any.</p>

<p>Strong Horses frequently fall a sacrifice to Diseases, by being kept
continually upon hard dry food, which feeding on soft Green herbage for
a few weeks would frequently cure sooner than any Physic.</p>

<p>It is recommended, that Horses in the Stable should occasionally have
<i>Green Meat</i>, viz. Rye, or Tares, &amp;c. which are carried about
London in Carts during the Spring, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A Horse will get fresher, by having a Run in a <i>Salt Marsh</i> for
One Month, such as at Plaistow, or the Isle of Dogs, &amp;c. than he will
in Two Months on Upland Grass.</p>

<p>“I have been told that it is no unusual thing to take up Horses from
the Marshes, and send <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>them on a long Journey directly, without any
preparation; and am the more ready to believe this, because I have
several times known Horses taken off the dry Commons in Winter, and
perform very well on the Road:—it is quite otherwise with those that
go on common Pastures, either in cold clay grounds, or where the Grass
is forced with Dung: many of these require a good deal of management
before they are fit to be put on hard service.”</p>

<p>Fields which lie near to Great Towns, and are much manured, do not
afford half such wholesome Hay or Pasture as those that are further
in the Country, and are not so forced. <i>Mr. Jarvis</i> says that he
would not thank ye for the Hay that is made within 10 miles of London.
The loads of Dung may make the Ground yield a more plentiful crop, but
it is always of an inferior, and often of injurious Quality.</p>

<p>Send your Horses to Grass where <i>the Pasture</i> is fine without
being forced, where the <i>Water</i> is good, and there is comfortable
<i>Shelter</i> for them to run to in Wet Weather: they should always
have Hay to go to, especially in Winter. You may be charged a trifle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>per Week more for this; but it is Money well spent, if you value your
Horse.</p>

<p><i>When a Horse returns from Grass</i>, although he may be free from
Disease, he is not fittest for Work; but will require a Week’s hard
Food, and must have Hay and Corn, and be gradually Exercised for
several days before he be put to Hard Work, or he will be apt to empty
himself too often, and is no Horse for a long Journey—unless you wish
to make a Skeleton of him.</p>

</div>
<hr class="r5">


<p>Young <i>Horses</i> are much more liable to Colds than those that are
full grown.</p>

<p><i>The most common cause of Colds</i> is riding or driving Horses till
they are Hot, and then suffering them to stand still where the Air is
cold and chilling.—Another very usual cause of Colds is removing a
Horse out of a Hot Stable to a Cold one:—a Cold taken this way will be
more violent, in the degree that a Horse has been highly fed and hotly
clothed: this is the reason why many Horses catch such very severe
Colds soon after they come out of a Dealer’s hands.—New-built Stables,
before they have been well aired and seasoned, and even Old Stables,
when they have stood long empty and grown damp, are dangerous to tender
Horses, that have been kept warm.</p>


<p class="center p2">WHEN A HORSE HAS CAUGHT A COLD,</p>

<p class="noindent">for his Diet let him have the sweetest and best Hay, and scalded Bran
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>and Water, with the chill taken off;—for his Physic, the following
prescription: let him be prepared for it (if his Disorder permits) the
two preceding days by some feeds of scalded Bran, which will render its
operation not only more easy, but more effective:—for those Horses
that have a narrow swallow, or that take Balls reluctantly, let the
Ball be dissolved in a pint of Ale or Gruel, made just milk-warm.</p>


<p class="center p2">HORSE BALLS</p>

<p class="noindent">should be made into an Oval shape, and not exceed the size of a
pullet’s Egg; when the dose is large, they may be made into two:
they should be dipped in Oil, that they may slip down with ease; for
striving much in thrusting down Balls, greatly increases a Horse’s
antipathy to such things, and renders it troublesome to administer them.</p>

<p>About three or four hours after, a Horse should have a feed of scalded
Bran: when he has eaten that up, he should have a small portion of
Sweet Hay let down into his Rack. He may have one or two more feeds
of scalded Bran the same day; and if he refuses to eat warm meat,
which some Horses will loathe that have been cloyed with it before,
he may be allowed raw Bran, which, if he drink sufficiently with it,
will do the business perfectly well. Let his drink be made milk-warm,
with a handful of Bran squeezed in it; but if he refuse to drink white
water freely, let him have it without the Bran, for his Physic will
always work the more, the more kindly he drinks, which let him do of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>warm water as much as he will. Early the next morning, he may have
another small feed of scalded Bran; but if he does not choose to Eat,
which sometimes happens before the Physic has begun to work, while his
stomach is squeamish, let him Drink as much water as he cares for,
with the Chill taken off, and ride him gently, beginning with a Walk,
and afterwards a gentle trot, which will help the operation of his
Medicine.—<i>Gibson on Horses</i>, 4to. p. 129. 1751.</p>

<p>There are few instances of the Ornamental triumphing over
the Useful in a more ridiculous degree, even in this <i>Age
of Eye-Architecture</i>,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> than in the usual management of
<i>Horses</i>, which some people seem to suppose are as fond of Heat as
Crickets. I have almost wondered that Stables have not been furnished
with Stoves to keep them of a regular Pine Apple heat: this might
improve the appearance of a Horse’s Coat: the fineness and smoothness
of which seems to be the grand desideratum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>Providence has protected the Horse with a coat of Hair sufficient
to defend him from the inclemencies of the severest Climate, which
Providentially begins to grow thicker about the month of October, and
increases in thickness as the Cold to which he is exposed increases.</p>

<p>But it is the Fashion at present to fancy that his Stable and Clothing
cannot be too close: in fact, many Horses are treated like Hot-house
Plants, and thereby rendered so delicate and tender, that they are
morbidly susceptible of all that vast train of complaints which are
caused by what is called</p>


<p class="center">“CATCHING COLD.”</p>

<p>The Door is generally the only entrance for Air, and that only when it
is occasionally open: the very threshhold of the Door is frequently
stopped up with Dung, and the Key-hole filled with Straw. In the
Morning, when the Door has been shut all Night, especially in Summer,
the heat is intolerable, and the Air absolutely unfit to breathe. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>is surprising that these poor creatures are not oftener found stifled
by the steams from their own bodies:—added to this, they are perhaps
muffled up in thick and tight Body Clothes.</p>

<p>“<i>In Summer</i> a single Sheet is fully sufficient for a <i>Horse
Cloth</i>, and in Winter, one Woollen Cloth is all that is requisite.
Neither Hacks nor Hunters should have <i>Head Cloths or Breast
Cloths</i>, which, though ornamental, are something worse than useless,
for they keep a part, while at rest, warm, which, as soon as the
Horse gets out, is the part that most meets the Cold Air, and is most
exposed.”</p>

<p>Hot-House Horses suffer severe Rheumatisms, &amp;c. upon every trifling
occasion:—a change of Stable—a Shower of Rain—standing still for a
little while in the open air, produce a variety of Disorders, Lameness,
Stiffness in their Joints, &amp;c. &amp;c.: in attempting to remove which,
after they have been tormented by cramping Shoes and Pailsful of
Physic, &amp;c., the poor creatures are pronounced incurable, and given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>over as “Foundered in the Chest,” or “Shook in the Shoulders,” or some
such equally unintelligible Jargon.</p>

<p>To cover a Horse with heavy Clothes while he is in a hot Stable, and to
strip him stark naked when he goes out into the Cold Air, is, I think,
as absurd a custom as can easily be imagined!—Gentle Reader, how would
You like to have your Great Coat put on while sitting by your Fire-side
in your Snug Parlour, which is of the comfortable temperature of 60,
and have it pulled off when you went out, and were obliged to stand
two or three hours with a cold wind blowing upon you of a chilling
temperature of 40, and perhaps Raining hard into the bargain?</p>

<p>Such treatment is as uncomfortable to a Horse as it would be to a Man;
and is the cause of the otherwise unaccountable premature mortality
of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>these valuable animals, especially of our London Carriage Horses,
which are often kept standing still exposed to the open air in cold and
damp weather for hours together!</p>

<p>When Carriage Horses are taken out in Wet Weather, they should have
<i>Water Decks</i> over their Loins, and be kept moving about every ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Where the ceiling of a Stable is low, and there is no window, the
best way to ventilate it is by a funnel passing up through the Stable
Ceiling, and through that of the Loft above.</p>

<p>Stables should be aired every day by keeping the Doors and Windows open
during the absence of the Horses. Experience teaches us how agreeable,
and indeed how indispensable fresh Air is in our own Apartments: it
is equally so to Horses; and one would almost suppose that Persons
who neglect to give it them never enjoyed the benefit of fresh Air
themselves.</p>

<p>As good <i>Master George Markham</i> tells us, in his Way to Wealth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>4to., 1638, p. 9, “<i>Coach Horses</i>, by reason of their many
occasions to stand still, must be inured to all Hardnesse.”</p>

<p>Never let Carriage Horses be clothed while in the Stable, but desire
your Coachman to carry their <i>Body Clothes</i> with him, and put
them on when they have a waiting Job, as he does his own <i>Box
Coat</i>;—the former will be as comfortable to his Horses, as the
latter is to himself.</p>

<p>A Coachman should make it a Rule (especially when he finds it cold
enough to put on his Great Coat) every quarter of an hour to move his
Horses about a little, and to draw round some Corner, so as to get out
of the Wind. It is not so much their being long out of Doors, but their
long standing quite still in a current of Cold Air, that injures Horses.</p>

<p>See more on this subject in the Chapter on Coachmen.</p>

CASE OF FIRE.</h2>
</div>
<hr class="r5">


<p>When a Fire happens, such is the natural dread of the horse, that
he cannot be prevailed on to move out of danger, but remains to his
certain destruction.</p>

<p>In this alarming case, it has been recommended, and practised with
success, (the opportunity of a few minutes offering,) to <i>blind</i>
the horses with any cloths which can be suddenly laid hold on, and
a Bridle or Halter also being put on, to <i>back</i> them out; for
when these animals see or smell fire, they obstinately refuse to move
forwards, but may be forced backward.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>If you do not wish your Horse to catch cold, Mount him the moment he
comes out of the Stable.</p>

<p>“<i>The Stirrups</i>,” says Lord Pembroke, in his Essay on Horses,
12mo. 1761, pp. 18 and 19, “must be of just such length, that when the
Rider, being well placed, puts his feet into them (about one-third of
each foot from the point of it) the point may be about two or three
inches higher than the heel when the Rider places himself upon the
Saddle strait, even, upright and well with his Legs hanging down, and
the stirrups likewise; and when he is in this position, take up the
stirrup, till the bottom of it comes just under the Ankle bone. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>Rider must not bear upon his Stirrups, but only let the natural weight
of his legs rest upon them.”</p>

<p>Always ride a hole or two shorter across the Country, than you do on
the Road.</p>

<p>Ride with a Snaffle, and use your Curb only occasionally.</p>

<p>Choose your Snaffle full and thick in the middle, especially at the
ends to which the reins are fastened. Most of them are made too small
and long, and cut the Horse’s mouth, and bend back over the bars of his
jaw, working like pincers.</p>

<p>If you ride with <i>a Curb</i>, make it a rule to hook on the chain
yourself; the quietest Horse may bring his rider into danger, should
the curb hurt him.</p>

<p>If in fixing the curb you turn the chain to the right, the links will
unfold themselves, and then oppose a further turning. Put on the chain
loose enough to hang down on the Horse’s under lip, so that it may not
rise and press his jaw till the reins of the Bridle are moderately
pulled.</p>

<p>Observe that your Horse is furnished with a Bit proper for him, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>by no means too heavy, which may incline him to carry low, or to rest
upon the hand when he grows weary, which Horsemen call “Making use of a
Fifth Leg.”</p>

<p>Always endeavour to avoid a Quarrel with your Horse:—if he is apt to
Start, you will find occasions enough to exercise his obedience when
what he starts at lies directly in his way, and you must make him pass:
if he is not subject to start, do not contend with him about a trifle.</p>

<p>The notion of the necessity of making a Horse go immediately up to
every thing he is afraid of, and not suffer him to become master of his
rider, seems to be generally carried too far. It is an approved method
to conquer a Horse’s fear of the sound of a Drum, by beating one near
to him at the time of feeding him: this not only familiarises the noise
to him, but makes it pleasant, as a forerunner of his Meat; whereas,
if he was whipped up to it, he might perhaps start at it as long as he
lived. Might not this be applied to his starting at other things, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>shew that it would be better to suffer him (provided he does not turn
back) to go a little from, and partly avoid an object he has a dislike
to, and to accustom him to it by degrees, convincing him, as it were,
that it will not hurt him, than to punish him, quarrel with him, and
perhaps submit to his will at last, while you insist on his overcoming
his fear in an instant? If he sees a like object again, it is probable
he will recollect his dread, and arm himself to be disobedient.</p>

<p>“Now of <i>Corrections</i>, the most principal is <i>the Spur</i>,
which must not at anytime be given triflingly or itchingly, but soundly
and sharply, as oft as just occasion shall require: then, the Rod,
which upon disorder, sloth, or miscarriage, of the members, must be
given also soundly: then, the Voice, which being delivered sharply and
roughly, as <i>Ha, Villaine!</i>—<i>Carrikra!</i>—<i>Diablo!</i>—and
such like threatenings, terrifieth the Horse, and maketh him afraide to
disobey: and lastly, the Bridle which now and then stricken with a hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>chocke in his mouth, reformeth many vices and distemperatures of his
head: yet this last must be done seldome, and with great discretion,
for to make a custom thereof is the ready way to spoil a Horse’s mouth.”</p>

<p>“Now of <i>Cherishings</i> there are generally in use but three; as
first, the voice, which being delivered smoothly and lovingly, as
crying <i>Holla</i>—<i>So, boy</i>—<i>There, Boy, There</i>—and such
like, gives the Horse both a cheerfulnesse of Spirit and a knowledge
that he hath done well: then the hand, by clapping him gently on the
necke or buttocke, or giving him Grasse or other foode to eate after
he hath pleased you: and lastly, the big ende of the rod, by rubbing
him therewith upon the withers or maine, which is very pleasing and
delightful to the horse.”—<i>Markham’s Way to Wealth</i>, 4to. 1638.
p. 16.</p>

<p>“The Hope of Reward, and the Fear of Punishment, governs the whole
World, not only Men, but Horses; for it is impossible that you can
well manage your Horse until he fear you, and out of that fear, Love
and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>Obey you; for it is Fear maketh every body obey both Man and
Beast. <i>Love is not so sure a Hold</i>, for there you depend upon his
Will; but when he Fears you, he depends upon yours.”—<i>Soleysell’s
Horsemanship</i>, fol. 1717. p. 272.</p>

<p><i>Old Blundevill</i>, in his 24th Chapter of his Book on Horses, 4to.
1609. p. 22, gives the following advice:—</p>

<p>“But because few keepers can correct with discretion, I would wish him
rather to use no correction at all, but only to winne him by gentle
meanes, by faire speaking, and by often clawing him and feeding him by
hand, and in Summer season, by wiping away Flies,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Nats, or other
things that doth annoy him: so shall the Horse be alwayes glad of him,
and rejoice in his presence, and in time become so familiar, as he will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>play with him like a dog; for, truely, unless there be mutual Lore
betwixt the keeper and the horse, the horse seldom or never battleth;
for if the keeper love not his horse, he will never meat him thoroughly
nor delight to dresse him, nor will the horse be delighted with his
dressing. And, therefore, the chiefest point of a horsekeeper is to
love his horse and to seeke to be loved againe of him; so shall he
profit the Horse and pleasure his Maister.”</p>

<p><i>Before you mount your Horse</i>, if you are only going to take an
Airing, examine whether the Bridle, Girths, and Straps, &amp;c. are all
good and well fixed, and that he is properly Shod.</p>

<p>It is manifest, that a considerable increase of pressure on the Heels
naturally follows—so that Lameness frequently attends the practice of
Frosting even for a short time.</p>

<p>The ordinary method of Frosting is by taking a Shoe off, heating it,
and turning up the Heel and Toe; but this being Iron only, it lasts,
for any efficient purpose, but a short time; and if hard worked, the
same process must be repeated almost daily, as long as the Frost
continues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>It is evident that the Hoof must suffer most severely by such a
continued and repeated perforation with the Nails; so that if a Frost
should happen to last a Month or two, it is probable there would be
scarcely horn enough left to nail a Shoe on with safety. When Frosting
is required, I have found that by <i>Steeling the Heels</i>, and if a
Draft Horse, the Toes also, that they will last considerably longer,
and consequently diminish the frequency of Driving Nails. A much
shorter Rough will answer, and the usual head will not need to be so
much altered.—<i>Goodwin on Shoeing Horses</i>, 8vo. p. 280. 1824.</p>

<p>The usual charge for Roughing the Shoes of Coach Horses, is 2<i>s.</i>
8<i>d.</i> per Horse.</p>

<p>To perform the operation so sensibly recommended by Mr. Goodwin, will
cost but little more, and the Shoes will certainly last much longer.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. Clark</i> recommends the following plan:—</p>

<p>“When the Roads, &amp;c. are covered with Ice, it becomes necessary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>have the Heels of the Shoes turned up, and frequently sharpened, in
order to prevent Horses from slipping and falling. As this cannot
be done without the frequent moving of the Shoes, which breaks and
destroys the crusts of the Hoofs where the Nails are drove, to prevent
this, I have always recommended to those who were willing to be at the
expense, to have <i>Steel Points</i> screwed into the Heels or quarters
of each Shoe, which might be taken out and put in as required.</p>

<p>“The method of doing this properly, is first to have the Shoes fitted
to the shape of the Hoof; then to make a small round Hole in the
extremity of each heel, or in the quarters, about three-eighths of an
inch in diameter or more, in proportion to the breadth and size of the
Shoe: in each of these holes a screw is to be made: the Steel points
are likewise to have a screw on them exactly fitted to that in the
Shoes. Care must be taken that the Screw on the points is no longer
when they are screwed into the Shoe than the thickness of the latter.
The Steel points are to be made sharp; they may either be made square
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>or triangular. The height of the point above the Shoe should not
exceed half an inch for a Saddle Horse: they may be made higher for a
Coach Horse.</p>

<p>“The Key or Handle that is necessary to screw them in and out
occasionally, is made in the shape of the Capital letter T, and of a
sufficient size and strength: at the bottom of the handle there is a
socket or cavity, properly adapted to the shape of the Steel point, and
so deep as to receive the whole point that is above the Shoe. In order
to prevent the screw from breaking at the neck, it will be necessary
to make it of a gradual taper: the same is likewise to be observed of
the female screw that receives it; that is, the hole must be wider on
the upper part of the Shoe than the under part: the sharp points may
be tempered or hardened, in order to prevent them growing too soon
blunt; but when they become blunt, they may be sharpened as at first.
These points should be unscrewed when the Horse is put into the Stable,
as the Stones will do them more injury in a few minutes there, than a
day’s riding on Ice. A Draught Horse should <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>have one point on the Toe
of each Shoe, as that gives him firmer footing in drawing on ice; but
for a Saddle Horse, when they are put there, they are apt to make them
trip and stumble.”</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that it is more convenient and much Cheaper,
even if you employ it as often as you would your own Carriage, to hire a Hackney Coach, than
it is to keep a Private Carriage; and if you only hire a Hackney Coach when you really want it,
if your Ten-toed machinery is in tolerable condition, instead of your Hackney Coach hire costing

moreover, your Health will be better preserved than if you walked less and rode more; the additional

<p>If you keep a Carriage, you will often be as much tempted to Ride, merely because

to have the power of using his own Legs.—Dr. Franklin advised a friend to <i>burn</i> his
Carriage, that he might get <i>heat</i> out of it at least once in his Life.</p>
</td>
<td class="tdl" style="vertical-align:top"> 4. In the Estimate (<a href="#ESTIMATE_No_IV">No. IV.</a>)
you have the Service of the Coachman occasionally, when he is not busy with his Horses and Carriage—and
if you keep a sharp lookout that your Carriage is kept in a good state of Repair, you will very rarely
be liable to those Accidents which sometimes happen to the infirm Constitution of a Hackney Coach:
moreover, you will be moved about  not merely with more Safety and more Celerity, but with
more Comfort, from knowing that you have a Pilot whom
you may depend upon:—the latter is an extremely important consideration to those whose business calls
them to places which are crowded with Carriages.
<p>When you wish your Mind to be active, and to do its
best, it should have nothing before it except the single object under its consideration; and the Body
should also be at Ease:—this, and the saving of time in passing from one place to another, are the
chief benefits a Carriage affords to Men of Business.</p>
<p>Again: it is a Rule with Hackney-coachmen to
take the shortest route; the consequence is, that as they naturally desire to perform their task as
soon as possible, if they think half a dozen yards are to be saved by it, unless specially directed,
they will bring you through all the nasty, narrow, badly ventilated and badly paved Lanes, &amp;c.
which they can find, and which, if you understand the value of Fresh Air, you would studiously avoid.</p>
<p>These vehicles are often used to convey sick people to Hospitals, especially Coaches: Chariots are
more easily ventilated, on account of their Front windows. Never get into a Hackney Coach that has
the Windows shut up, if there is one on the Stand of which the Windows are open;—stagnant Air is
always Offensive, and often Infectious.</p></td>

<p>Get an accurate Map of London, on a Scale of not less than 6 Inches
to a Mile; set a pair of Compasses (or rather, what I believe are
called <i>Dividers</i>, which have a screw that fixes them firmly to
any distance at which you wish to keep them separate,) to a Furlong,
and with them you may easily measure any distance—allow for Turnings,
and keep your reckoning short by at least half a Furlong, that is, 20
Poles, <i>i. e.</i> 330 feet in each Mile: as some Guide to guess this,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>Houses in London being, on an Average, not more than 20 feet in front,
stop within at least 16 houses of what you consider to be the full Mile.</p>

<p>A Map of the Metropolis, laid down from actual measurement on a scale
of an Inch to a Furlong, <i>i. e.</i> of 8 Inches to a Mile, is much
wanted;—with it and a pair of Compasses, all Hackney Coach Fares might
be settled with the utmost ease, and with sufficient exactness, to
satisfy All, except litigious triflers, who are more Nice than Wise.</p>

<p>I read the foregoing paragraph to <i>Mr. Cary, the Map-maker, of St.
James’s Street</i>, who replied, “I have had thoughts of publishing a
Map on the scale you mention; on such a plan, that by merely looking at
it, the distances might be determined within Twenty Poles, <i>i. e.</i>
within the ¹⁄₁₆th part of a Mile.”</p>

<p>Such a Map would be a very great acquisition, and I hope Mr. C. will
meet with encouragement sufficient to induce him to put his design into
execution speedily, as it would form a certain standard by which all
questions respecting distances might be immediately adjusted, to the
satisfaction of both parties.</p>

<p>To make an actual Measurement of every Street with a Measuring Wheel,
would not cost more than £500.; to affix the Distances under the Names
of the Street, not so much: the Expense might in part be defrayed by
the Sale of a Map of London, on the scale of one Inch to a Furlong,
laid down accurately from such an exact survey, and a Volume like
<i>Cary’s Guide for Ascertaining Hackney Coach Fares</i>; of which very
curious and useful Work, see a specimen at the end of this Chapter.</p>

<p>Make a list of Fares, North, South, East, and West, from your House,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>of 1<i>s</i>., 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., and 2<i>s</i>., taking care to
add thereto the distance from the Stand, or Place whence the Coach is
called.</p>

<p><i>To acquire a general idea of Distances</i>, draw on a Map, of the
scale before mentioned, Circles around your House of two Miles, of
three Miles, and of four Miles in diameter, the Semi-diameter of which
will give the distance from your residence of a Mile, a Mile and a
half, and Two Miles, <i>i. e.</i> of Shilling, Eighteen-penny, and Two
Shilling Fares.</p>

<p>Hackney Coaches travel, on an average, about 5 miles an hour, seldom
more than 6, nor less than 4:—therefore, riding at the rate of 5
miles in an hour, costs about A Penny a Minute; and when you have
been carried for 12 minutes, (look at your Watch when you enter the
Carriage, and make allowance for stoppages,) you may reckon that you
have 12 Pence to pay:—above 24 minutes, the Fares increase in a higher
ratio, as above Two Miles is 3<i>s</i>.</p>

<p>The advantage of such Calculation is, if you are set down a few
Poles within Two miles, you save, first, Sixpence on the Ground, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>secondly, the extra Sixpence to which the Coachman is entitled on
exceeding every Two miles; making the difference of a Shilling for
perhaps a single Yard.</p>

<p><i>Before you get into a Hackney Coach</i>, take the Number: it is
especially advisable to do so, when you hire a Coach to carry home
Ladies, and then do it in such a way, that the Driver may observe
that you have taken his Number; and to complete your Care, ask the
Coachman what his Fare is, which, if your Gallantry is as great as your
Circumspection, you may perhaps do yourself the pleasure of Paying.</p>

<p>If the Coachman conducts himself improperly, or if any thing is left in
the Carriage, apply to your friend <i>Mr. Quaife</i><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>: by summoning
the Coachman to the Hackney Coach Office, at the bottom of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>Essex
Street in the Strand, or to one of the Police Offices, you will most
probably recover it.</p>

<p><i>Avoid any dispute with a Hackney Coachman</i>—pay what he demands,
although you know it to be more than his Fare, and seek redress at the
Office in Essex Street.</p>

<p>The Driver of a Hackney Coach has the option of charging<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> either for
the <i>Time</i> he is detained, or for the <i>Distance</i>:—Time is
rated at less than half what is charged for Travelling.</p>

<p>When you intend to be charged according to <i>the Time</i> you keep
the Coach, in order to prevent any dispute when you discharge it, tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>the Coachman the time when he first arrived, making allowance for the
minutes that he has been coming from the Stand whence he was called.</p>

<p>The Machine used to measure the distances at the Hackney Coach Office
is called “<i>a Perambulator</i>,” or “<i>Surveying Wheel</i>.”—This
consists of a Wheel which is 8 Feet 3 Inches, <i>i. e.</i> half a Pole,
in circumference; so in two revolutions it measures one pole, or 16½
feet. One revolution of this Wheel turns a single-threaded worm once
round; the worm takes into a Wheel of 80 teeth, and turns it once round
in 80 revolutions: on the socket of this wheel is fixed an index,
which makes one revolution in 40 Poles, or one <i>Furlong</i>; on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>axis of this worm is fixed another worm with a single thread, turning
about a wheel of 160 teeth, whose socket carries an index that makes
one revolution in 80 Furlongs, or 10 Miles: on the dial plate there
are three graduated circles; the outermost is divided into 220 parts,
or the <i>Yards</i> in a Furlong; the next into 40 parts, the number
of <i>Poles</i> in a Furlong; the third into 80 parts, the number of
<i>Furlongs</i> in ten Miles, every Mile being distinguished by its
proper Roman figure.</p>

<p>The above Apparatus, <span class="smcap">Mr. Harris</span>, Mathematical Instrument
maker, No. 50, High Holborn, makes for £12. 12<i>s.</i>: it may be
attached to the wheel of a Carriage, and the Dial will shew the
progress made in Travelling, and then is called a <i>Way-wiser</i>.</p>

<p>This Machine may be applied to any kind of Chaise or Carriage, and may
be put on and off at pleasure, without any injury to either.</p>

<p>It will accurately register the number of Miles the Vehicle travels
over, to any distance. It is fixed so as to be of no possible detriment
to the Carriage, and can be ornamented as elegantly as fancy may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>desire. A Time-piece may be attached to it, by which may be seen the
Distance travelled per Hour.</p>

<p>I can think of only One way of <i>infallibly preventing all disputes
about Distance</i>, between the Riders in and the Drivers of Hackney
Coaches.</p>

<p><i>To Regulate all the fares by Time</i>, according to the present
charge for Time, 2<i>s.</i> for the first hour, and 3<i>s.</i> for
every hour after: as the Pace in Travelling seldom exceeds five Miles
in an Hour, about double the sum is charged while the Coach is in
motion that is charged while it is in waiting. Let after the rate of
Five or Six Shillings per hour be paid while the Wheels are going
round;—this could be much easier reckoned than the Distance they have
gone over, and would put an end to all Disputes on the subject.</p>

<p>To determine exactly between an extremely long <i>Twelve</i>, and an
extremely short <i>Eighteen-penny</i> fare, is not a very easy task
to the most Experienced: it is, in fact, determining whether you have
proceeded 1760 or 1761 Yards!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>A friend of mine informs me, that he puzzled himself and the Hackney
Coachman too on one occasion, by pulling him up so that the Horses
had exceeded the Shilling fare, and the Coach had not. This deserves
to be referred to a <i>full</i> bench of Justices. They might, at the
same time, decide how it would be, if the Coach had been stopped, so
that the two fore Wheels were in the above predicament of the Horses,
and the other two in that of the Coach. Perhaps then it would make the
difference of 6<i>d.</i> on which side the passengers sat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Query.</span> Can persons who can afford to ride in a Hackney Coach
lay out <i>Sixpence</i> more to their own advantage than in spending
it to prevent their being put out of Temper?—If they are going out to
Dinner, any disagreeable irritation of the Animal Spirits will destroy
their Appetite;—if they are returning Home, it will as inevitably
invite an Indigestion. Surely no man who is worth a Shilling, would
encounter either of these tremendous evils for the sake of Sixpence!

much mischief to Man’s person as it does good to his Potatoes, often
produces the most dangerous Diseases, and even Death itself!</p>

<p>In a note in the <i>Prolegomena</i> of Malone’s supplement to Johnson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>and Steevens’s Shakespeare, we have the following account of</p>

<p class="center p2">THE ORIGIN OF HACKNEY COACHES.</p>

<p>“I cannot (says Mr. Garrard) omit to mention any new thing that comes
up amongst us, though never so trivial. Here is one Captain Bailey, he
hath been a Sea Captain, but now lives on the land, about this city,
where he tries experiments. He hath erected, according to his ability,
some <i>four Hackney Coaches</i>, put his men in livery, and appointed
them to stand at the Maypole in the Strand; gives them instructions at
what rates to carry men into the several parts of the Town, where all
day they may be had. Other Hackneymen seeing this, flocked to the same
place, and performed their journey at the same rate, so that sometimes
there are twenty of them together, which disperse up and down, that
they and others are to be had every where, as watermen are to be had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>by the water-side. Every body is much pleased with it. For whereas,
before, coaches could not be had but at great rates; now a man may have
one much cheaper.”</p>

<p>This Letter is dated April 1, 1634.—See <i>Gents. Mag. for 1780</i>,
p. 375.</p>

<p>The Rules given in the preceding pages will protect the Rider from
extortion on the part of the Driver, beyond <i>Sixpence</i>; and for
that, is it worth contending? However the furious Economist, and

<p>The Price of Labour is usually in proportion to the degree of Skill or
Strength requisite to perform any operation, or to the Disagreeableness
of the work, or to the Detriment it occasions to Health:—few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>situations are more disagreeable, or more destructive to Health, than
the exposure at all Hours to extreme Heat in Summer, and intense Cold

<p class="center p2">THE PROFITS OF A HACKNEY COACHMAN</p>

<p class="noindent">so large as his hard service seems to indicate that they ought
to be—though the Outfit does not cost much. <i>A Coach</i> may
be purchased for about £30. or £40.—<i>a Chariot</i> for about
£20.—<i>the Horses</i> may be had from £8. to £20. each:—but, as the

<p class="noindent">Bad Horses have as good an appetite as the best: ay, sometimes a
better, (if Goodness be measured by Greatness,) in the same way that
bad land wants more manure than good. It may be said, that the inferior
Provender provided for these poor hard-worked Hacks, is not so dear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>as that which is purchased for the pampered animal, whose sleek coat
is his Master’s pride: but it must be taken into the account, that
if their Food be somewhat cheaper, their Stomachs are so constantly
stimulated by those strongest excitements to good Appetite, Air and
Exercise, that they are ever and aye, “<i>as Hungry as a Hunter</i>,”
and eat nearly double what those Horses do who pass their days
indolently in an over-heated Stable: indeed, we think that to be “<i>as
Hungry as a Hackney Coach Horse</i>” must be a few degrees beyond
being as Hungry as a Hunter; or one degree nearer to that state which
is considered by the <i>Grand Gourmand</i> as the most enviable in
Existence.</p>

<p>It is told of a certain worthy and wealthy Citizen, who has acquired
the reputation of being a considerable Consumer of the good things of
the Table, and has been “widened at the expense of the Corporation,”
that on coming out of a Tavern, after a Turtle Feast, a poor Boy
begged Charity of him—“For Mercy’s sake, Sir, I am so very Hungry!”
“<i>Hungry!</i>—<i>Hungry!</i>—hey!—what!—<i>complain</i> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>being <i>Hungry</i>!—why I never heard the like!—complain of
being <i>Hungry</i>!!—<i>Prodigious</i>!!!—why I’d give a Guinea
to be <i>Hungry</i>!!!—why, a Hungry Man (with a good Dinner before
him) is the Happiest fellow in the world!—There, (giving the Boy
Half-a-Crown,) there, I don’t want you to take my word for it: run
along, my fine fellow, and make the experiment Yourself.”</p>

<p>The above Estimate, however considerable it may appear, will not be
considered as too high, when it is recollected that the Carriage is in
continual use, that the Horses are exposed to all weathers, and are
often Over-worked and Under-fed.</p>

<p>Hackney Coachmen get upon the Stands about nine in the Morning, and are
often out till past twelve at Night, except those who work double, who
take out one Coach and Horses Early in the Morning, bring them home at
about six or seven in the Evening, and then take out another pair for
Night-work.</p>

<p>It appears from <i>Mr. Jervis’s Journal</i>, which account I believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>to be “quite correct,” that <i>the Harvest of a Hackney Coachman</i>,
like the Hay-farmer’s, is in the Sultry Summer Months.</p>

<p>We can defend ourselves from Cold and Rain much more easily than we can
from the fatigue brought on by walking in Hot Weather.</p>

<p>The Vauxhall season is another source of considerable profit to the
proprietors of the Leathern Conveniences.</p>

<p><i>The least productive Months</i> are February, March, and April: this
may be partly accounted for, by the Economy which is so inevitably
submitted to during those months, occasioned by People’s pockets being
drained by Christmas Bills and Christmas Gambols.</p>

<p>On an average of Forty weeks, it seemed, that <i>the most productive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>Days</i> are Wednesdays and Thursdays. This may, in some measure, be
accounted for, by the greater number of Dinner parties, &amp;c. which are
given on those days.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent uses of these accommodating Vehicles, is
to carry People out to Dinner. The following hint, every one who is
equally a true lover of polite Punctuality and of a Hot Dinner, will
think Good Advice.</p>

<p>An Excuse, which is as foolish as it is common, but which a furious
Economist seems to fancy is a sufficient plea for spoiling the best
Feast, is, “<i>there was not a Coach to be had</i>.” Uncalculating
and Improvident! not to send for one till the very last moment. You
save nothing by it!—you spoil your Friend’s Dinner! and excite the
displeasure of his Guests!!—and all this—to save your dear, dear
self, <i>Sixpence</i>!!! (or as I found it in <i>Mr. Jervis’s MS.</i>
“a little white farthing.”) As such a Mite would have prevented it,
although your Polite host may pretend not to notice your Rudeness, no
Apology that you may make can cancel such a confirmed certificate of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>your Selfish Impertinence; therefore be not so silly as to fancy that
it will. Remember the English Proverb, “Hunger and Anger are nearly
allied;” and the Scotch saying, that “Hungry people are aye Angry.”</p>

<p>Equity requires that you ought to take the first Coach on the Stand,
however little you may like the appearance of the Driver, the Carriage,
or the Horses; because the occupier of that place having obtained
it by being the longest in waiting, has therefore a fair claim to
a preference, which it is apparently unjust not to grant: However,
we have heard persons give the following advice—<i>If you are in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>haste</i>, take the Coach, the Driver of which is on the Box, the
Horses bitted, and who stand with their faces towards the way you wish
to go:—if not in a hurry, Open your Eyes, and choose that Vehicle to
which the tidy appearance of it and its Driver attract you, and present
ocular demonstration that the Carriage is clean, and the Coachman
careful.</p>

<p><i>The Servants of Industry</i> are known by their Livery, which is
always <i>whole and wholesome</i>—the <i>Slaves of Idleness</i>
are slovenly and loathsome:—the former, generally prove Civil and
honest,—the latter, Impertinent and imposing.</p>

<p><i>When going out to Dinner</i>, Beware of indulging your Benevolence
by conferring the silly Sixpenny Civility of taking up every person
that is bound to the same house: such mighty good kind of Gentry are
commonly too late. However, since Colonel <span class="smcap">Bosville</span> established
the right laudable custom of locking out all those who come after the
appointed hour, this caution has become almost needless; as now the
rudeness of those who come too late, by such a prudent order to your
Porter, very properly recoils upon Themselves:—Good Dinner-Giver, let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>such perfunctory persons be locked out!</p>

<p>Let those who wish to ensure Punctuality, have their Letter of

<p><i>Messrs. Champaigne</i> and <i>Turtle</i> request the honour of
Messrs. <i>Thirst</i> and <i>Hunger’s</i> company at Dinner on Thursday
the 9th Nov., five minutes <i>before</i> Five o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nota Bene.</span>—Messrs. C. and T. have directed, that as soon as

<p>A prudent General always provides for a Retreat.</p>

<p><i>The Best way of securing a Coach to bring you Home</i>, if it is a
long distance, is to keep the Coach in waiting—or tell the Driver to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>call and take you home at a certain hour; or fee the Waterman at the
nearest Stand, to send one at the hour you wish.</p>

<p>A Facetious Friend of the Editor’s, on a very Wet Night, after several
Messengers, whom he had despatched for a Coach, had returned without
obtaining one: at last, at “past one o’clock, and a Rainy Morning,” the
Wag walked himself to the next Coach-stand, and politely advised the
Waterman to mend his Inside lining with a Pint of Beer, and go home to
bed; for, said he, “there will be nothing for you to do to-Night,—I’ll
lay you a Shilling that there’s not a Coach out.”—“Why, will you, your
Honour? then, done,” cried Mr. Waterman; “but are you really serious,
’cause, if so be as You be, I must make haste and go and get one.”
Being assured he would certainly touch the Twelve-penny if he did, He
trotted off on his “Nag a ten toes,” and in Ten minutes returned with
a Leathern Convenience.—<i>Bonaparte</i> used to say, “In some cases,
there is nothing like a Subsidy.”</p>

Vehicle in a paved and crowded street—especially, at the rapid rate at
which some perfunctory people require them to keep moving. If the Horse
be ever so sure-footed, and the Driver ever so skilful and steady, they
are frightfully dangerous Vehicles for town work, and will only be
used by those who are rash enough to sacrifice safety to Celerity, and
Comfort to Cheapness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mem.</span>—A Coachman may contract to drive you to a certain
Place for a certain Sum, and if it exceeds the distance which you are

<p>For Coaches hired to go into the country in the day-time, and there
discharged, additional fares are to be taken for their return to
the pavement or next stand where hired, as follow: for 10 miles,

his returning.</p>

<p><i>Abusive Language.</i>—The Drivers behaving rudely, or using abusive
Language, are to forfeit not more than £10,—in default of payment, are

not exceeding two months.</p>

<p><i>Extortion.</i>—Coachmen refusing to go on, or extorting more than
their fare, are to forfeit not more than 3<i>l.</i> nor less than
10<i>s.</i> Not only the Commissioners in Essex Street, Strand, but
also the Magistrates at the Police-offices, determine such Offences,
and inflict Punishments.</p>

<p><i>Obligation to go on.</i>—If a Coach be drawn off the Stand to the
side of the pavement, it is equally as liable to be hired as if it
stood on the Stand, and the Coachman may be made to go with you, if not
hired—if he refuses, he is liable to be fined. They are compellable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>if plying for hire, at any hour of the Day or the Night, to go upon
all Turnpike roads, any where within Two miles and a half from the end
of the Carriage-way pavement.</p>

<p><i>Articles left in a Hackney Coach</i> are (by a late Act) to be taken
to the Hackney Coach Office, Essex Street, Strand, on pain of paying
20<i>l.</i>; to be recovered on application to the Commissioners, or a
Justice of the Peace.</p>

<p>The Coachman is to take the shortest way, and to charge accordingly:
but if he, from choice or ignorance, does otherwise, he can make no
extra charge.</p>

<p>He may refuse to take <i>Heavy Luggage</i>, unless he is paid something
more than the fare; but he must object to it before it be put into the
Coach: he cannot, however, object to take a small Parcel that may be
carried in the hand.</p>

<p><i>When a Coachman is desired to wait</i>, he may demand a sum in hand
beyond his previous fare, and is accountable for such sum when you
discharge him. He is not bound to wait without such a <i>detainer</i>,
nor longer than it will pay for the time.</p>

their progress. Should the coachman leave the box, this invention will
enable him to prevent the possibility of the horses starting off in
his absence; or should he be thrown from his seat, or fall off in a
fit, or from any other cause, an infirm person or even a Child in the

<p class="hang" style="margin-left: -1.5em;"><i>Sir Richard</i> has very properly applied to the <i>Duellist</i>
what <i>Dr. South</i> has said of the Liar: “<i>He is a Coward to
Man</i>, and a <i>Bravo to</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>!”</p>

<p class="hang" style="margin-left: -1.5em;">The most ridiculous circumstance respecting <i>Duelling</i>, is, that
the Man who has suffered the Injury must submit himself to the same
Peril with him who inflicted it, so that the Punishment is entirely
accidental, and as likely to fall upon the Innocent as the Guilty.</p>

<a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">25</a> So called by “The Oracle,” from the furious sacrifice
of the comfort of the Interior of our Modern Houses to the paltry
plaister patchwork of (what the Vulgar pronounce) “a pretty Elevation.”
Aye!—pretty may be for part of a Palace—but as inconvenient as it is
impertinent for a Private Dwelling.

stopped, or by the <i>hour</i> (<i>à l’heure</i>). The fare is 30 sous
(1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>) per course, whether it be a quarter of a Mile
or three Miles; or two francs (1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) for the first
hour, and 30 sous (1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>) per hour afterwards.

<p class="hang" style="margin-left: -1.5em;">“From midnight to 6 o’clock in the morning, the fare is doubled.</p>

child, nor to take any heavy luggage.</p>

<p class="hang" style="margin-left: -1.5em;">“If the Coach be hired by Time, the first hour must be paid for,
whether it is entirely occupied or not; but it is not necessary to pay
for more of the second, or of any succeeding hour, than has actually
elapsed.</p>

<p class="hang" style="margin-left: -1.5em;">“If a coach is engaged to go to the Theatres, or to any place of
public amusement, it is customary to pay the coachman at the time of
starting, in order to avoid delay at alighting.”—<i>Planta’s Picture

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
